"'\nI would now like to hand the conference over to one of your speakers today, Keith McCue, SVP, Finance and Investor Relations.', ""\nBefore we begin, I'm obliged to caution that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those discussed."", ""\nWith us to discuss today's results are: Kevin O'Donnell, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Qutub, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer."", ""\nKevin O'Donnell -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Keith."", '\nIn many ways, last year was a trying one, but it was also a year of great opportunity.', '\nIn short, we transformed the profile of the company to ensure we continue to benefit our shareholders over the long-term.', '\nAs we have said many times, we evaluate our casualty business over rolling 10-year periods.', '\nShifting gears briefly to capital management, which Bob will address in greater detail.', '\nStarting with our consolidated results where we reported net income of $457 million and operating income of $278 million for the quarter.', ""\nI'll now shift to our three drivers of profit starting with underwriting income."", '\nFor our Property segment specifically, gross premiums written grew $141 million over the comparable quarter or 14% and we reported a combined ratio of 44%, driven by a lack of cat losses and strong performance in our other property business and $51 million in prior year favorable loss development.', '\nMost of the growth in our property catastrophe business took place in our joint ventures.', '\nNow moving on to our second driver of profit, fee income.', '\nOur Medici and Epsilon funds raised in aggregate over $200 million in new quarter capital this year, which we deployed it to June 1 renewal.', '\nTurning now to our third driver of profit, investment income.', '\nAnd turning now to our expenses and starting with the acquisition expense ratio, which was up slightly to 24%.', '\nOur direct expense ratio, which is the sum of our operational and corporate expenses divided by net premiums earned, was flat from the prior quarter at 6%.', ""\nI'd like to now shift to our discussion on our capital management during the quarter."", '\nAs a reminder, last year, we redeemed the outstanding $125 million of our 6.', '\nEven with the incremental $225 million raised this month, we are comfortable with our various capital ratios which are stronger than two years ago.', '\nSubsequent to the quarter-end, we continued to repurchase shares and, as of July 19, had repurchased an additional 920,000 shares for $138 million at an average price of just over $149 a share.', '\nDespite substantial quarterly share repurchases, we ended the quarter with more capital than we began, which reflects our excess earnings, net of share buybacks and dividend.', ""\nNow before turning the call back over to Kevin, I'd like to finish with a brief discussion on tax."", '\nOver the years, however, the flexibility of our global operating platform has proven resilient and we anticipate this resilience will persist.', '\nSo, in closing, we are pleased with our solid financial performance this quarter across our three drivers of profit and believe we have demonstrated proactive capital management, which should continue to contribute to shareholder value.', ""\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back over to Kevin."", '\nOur existing other property book has access to some of the most dislocated property lines in the US E&S market.', '\nWe also grew our property cat portfolio this quarter but by a smaller percentage.', ""\nAs we anticipated on last quarter's call, we reduced the number of Florida programs that we wrote from 18 to 13, which is a continuation of last year's trend when we reduced from 25 programs."", '\nThat said, decreased exposure to Florida domestics is not the same thing as decreased exposure to Florida hurricanes.', '\nInflation has been in the news recently with headline CPA in May exceeding 5%.', '\nFrom our perspective as a reinsurer, it was a quiet quarter for tax.', ""\nYou've probably read news reports about wildfires and record droughts already in the US, particularly in California."", '\nI am often asked if we vary the amount of business that we write based on weather forecasts.', '\nMoving now to our Casualty and Specialty segment.', '\nReflecting over my career, I believe that many underwriters do not go large enough when opportunity knocks or small enough when it recedes.', '\nCasualty and Specialty losses, including those related to COVID-19, continue to develop within our expectations.', '\nAs I mentioned on our previous calls, in the Casualty business, our actuaries are being patient in recognizing positive rate movements.', '\nClosing now with our Capital Partners business.', '\nSince 2015, we have grown our Capital Partners business from four vehicles and $6 billion in capital to six vehicles with more than $11 billion in capital.', '\nIn conclusion, we delivered a solid quarter with strong premium growth, improving profitability and proactive capital management.', ""\nAnd with that, I'll open it up for questions."", '\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.', ""\nKevin O'Donnell -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah."", ""\nKevin O'Donnell -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure."", ""\nSo when I think about the future, we're in a capital position where that money is deployed, we have additional capital that we are targeting for future growth going into 2022."", ""\nKevin O'Donnell -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure."", ""\nRobert Qutub -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nI'll take that one, Ryan."", ""\nIf you look back over the last few years, we've taken it out from a very conservative duration that you would expect with a property cat company short-tail."", ""\nKevin O'Donnell -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nOne thing I'd add to that is, in thinking about the portfolios that we construct and my comments about southeast winds still being a big risk for us, we also place very high goals for our liquidity, so that given any sort of caravan or liquidity is available."", ""\nKevin O'Donnell -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah."", ""\nKevin O'Donnell -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSo, let me talk a little bit about our portfolio."", '\nWhat I would say is, our methodology is exactly the same as what it was three, four, five years ago.', ""\nAre you of the view that there are a lot of, I guess, ACR that cedents haven't put up enough for those recent accident years and the way your reserves were contemplated as your IBNR and ACR is an axis of what you're getting from cedents?"", '\nIn general, we start with a higher expected ultimate than many of our customers.', '\nJoshua Shanker -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nI certainly hope so.', ""\nKevin O'Donnell -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you."", '\nMeyer Shields -- KBW -- Analyst\nGreat.', ""\nKevin O'Donnell -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI think there's two ways in this national carriers buy, one is including Florida and one is a Florida-specific."", '\nSo, when I look at our portfolio at the overall property level, your comments are accurate for property cat.', '\nMeyer Shields -- KBW -- Analyst\nOkay.', '\nMeyer Shields -- KBW -- Analyst\nRight.', '\nRobert Qutub -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nOh, the expense -- OK.', '\nMeyer Shields -- KBW -- Analyst\nOkay.', '\nRobert Qutub -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSo I think the question, Mike, was on cash changes in the portfolio?', ""\nKevin O'Donnell -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah."", '\nBrian Meredith -- UBS -- Analyst\nYes.', ""\nKevin O'Donnell -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSo, firstly, I believe losses will be more expensive this year because of inflation."", ""\nGoing in this year, we already know there's pressures there."", '\nBrian Meredith -- UBS -- Analyst\nGreat.', ""\nKevin O'Donnell -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nIt's early."", '\nBrian Meredith -- UBS -- Analyst\nGreat.', ""\nKevin O'Donnell -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure."", ""\nKevin O'Donnell -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah."", ""\nKevin O'Donnell -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSo I think not all of this are things that are easily seen from outside the four walls of RenRe."", '\nSo all of that plays into the consumption of capital within our portfolio.', ""\nSo, when I look at it, it's a combination of greater efficiency with our portfolio, partially because we've had more opportunity to share it with third-party investors and others and convert it to fee income."", '\nRobert Qutub -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThanks for the question.', ""\nKevin O'Donnell -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah."", '\nMeyer Shields -- KBW -- Analyst\nThanks.', ""\nKevin O'Donnell -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah I think rates won't go up forever."", '\nMeyer Shields -- KBW -- Analyst\nOkay.', ""\nKevin O'Donnell -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks everybody for joining our conference call today.""]"
"""\nToday, the company issued a press release announcing its first quarter and 2021 financial results, a copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on the investor relations

well for the long-term outlook of this segment.', ""\nLike me, I'm sure our team remains highly motivated to capitalize on the strong list of opportunities in front of us."", '\nretail sales of golf equipment hard goods were up 49% compared to Q1 2019 and 72% compared to 2020, thus setting another record for Q1 just as the last two quarters delivered records for their respective time periods.',

and new entrants to the game."", '\nAs our most recent share trends are improving, we expect this improvement to continue through Q2, and we are performing relatively stronger in key accounts that are not reporting to Datatech as well as a strategically important green grass channel.', '\nLooking at the larger individual businesses in this segment, starting with TravisMathew, we had high expectations for growth, and still, the business exceeded these expectations.', '\nAlthough these circumstances have significantly impacted our business, how could they not?', '\nOur sell-through momentum in this business is good, and prebooks for the full winter line have been quite strong.', ""\nWe are really pleased with the leadership team we now have in place, and I'm increasingly confident in the future of this brand."", '\nThese investments enable our apparel business e-com to deliver 96% year-over-year growth in Q1.', '\nLike our company overall, this segment, with its concentration in golf and outdoor, appears to be well positioned for both the months and years ahead both during the pandemic and after.', '\nArtie brings a wealth of valuable experience and talent to an already strong management team and an exciting business.', '\nCOVID impacted, so these include the impact of venues shut or restricted during COVID during the period.', '\nOur financial results benefited from the same venue sales fee as well as the operating efficiencies that are higher than both historical levels and our plan.', '\nWe successfully installed 1,533 bays in Q1, a new record despite the COVID challenges globally.', '\nThese include incremental new store openings at TravisMathew, investments in demand creation and digital resources for all brands, as well as the apparel business.', '\nMore specifically, We are now expecting our legacy business to exceed its 2019 results and the Topgolf business to meet or exceed its 2019 full-year results, as measured over the full 12-month period.', '\nIn addition to this better-than-expected operating performance, our liquidity has also improved substantially compared to a year ago.', '\nFirst, as a result of the OGIO, TravisMathew and Jack Wolfskin acquisition, we incurred non-cash amortization expense of intangible assets in the first quarter of 2021 and 2020.', '\nThird, we recognized in the first quarter of 2021 a $253 million non-cash gain related to the write-off of our premerger Topgolf investment.', '\nTopgolf generally operates in a 13-week quarter.', '\nWe have provided in the tables to this release a schedule detailing the impact of these items on first-quarter results, and these items are excluded from our non-GAAP results.', '\nThis increase was led by a 26% increase in the legacy Callaway business, as well as an incremental $93 million from the four weeks of the Topgolf business.', '\nThe increase in non-GAAP operating income was led by a $50 million increase in segment operating income from the legacy Callaway business as well as an incremental $4 million from the four weeks of the Topgolf business.', '\nThe $2 million increase in other expense was primarily related to higher interest expense related to incremental interest from the convertible bonds issued in May 2020, plus four weeks of Topgolf interest, partially offset by a decrease in foreign currency-related losses.', '\nNon-GAAP earnings per share was $0.', ""\nThe golf equipment segment's net revenue increased $85 million or 29% to, $377 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $292 million in the first quarter of 2020."", '\nThe increase was driven by the increased revenue, operating expense leverage and favorable foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased freight and product mix, including lower margins on our higher technology golf club product offerings and package sets.', ""\nThe apparel, gear and other segment's operating income increased $24 million to $20 million compared to a loss of $4 million for the same period in the prior year."", ""\nThe Topgolf segment's operating income was $4 million for the four-week stub period."", '\nAs of March 31, 2021,

the end of the first quarter of the prior year.', '\nFrom a full-year 2021 forecast perspective, the legacy Callaway forecast is increasing to approximately $65 million versus the previous forecast of 50 million due to capacity investments in our plants and warehouses, as well as increasing the number of play in TravisMathew retail stores.', '\nNon-GAAP depreciation and amortization expense was $17 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $8 million in 2020.', '\nFor 2021, it is treated as a discount to sales as opposed to an operating expense in 2020 and 2019.', '\nWe previously estimated that the freight container shortage was expected to have a negative impact of $13 million on freight costs in 2021, with a substantial majority affecting the first half.', '\nIn addition, we plan to invest a little more back into our business than originally planned.', ""\nWe're seeing increased freight costs in terms of increased container prices, but also increased air freight expense

digital billing increased by more than 10% year over year on a same-unit or same-store basis, growth that reflects both higher rates and better sell-through.', '\nSo to repeat, we expect as we move

"'\nLet me begin by giving you an overview of selected key highlights in 2020 and of the success we were able to achieve since the beginning of this year.', '\nWe are further expanding the COVID-19 vaccine program and are expecting to initiate three clinical trials soon.', '\nFollowing the promising results announced in the third quarter of 2020, the expansion of the Phase 1 trial aims to confirm the safety and preliminary efficacy of CV8102 at a selected dose of 600 micrograms.', '\nWe reaffirm our anticipated manufacturing capacity for 2021 of up to 300 million dosages produced and have raised our manufacturing guidance for 2022 to 1 billion doses of CVnCoV.', '\nWe believe that this progress has put us into an optimal position to further grow the business and accelerate our corporate transformation and development from a biotech into a commercial biopharma company.', '\nMoving into 2021, we continue to transform as a business and move toward executing on our core mandate to deliver a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine.', '\nFor COVID-19, CureVac and GSK are already jointly developing second-generation vaccines based on new mRNA backbones.', '\nIn protein therapy, in addition to collaborating with CRISPR Therapeutics and Genmab, we have also collaboration with Yale and Harvard University that are focused on lung diseases and ocular diseases.', '\nHalf of the ongoing large-scale COVID-19 vaccination programs for administration with seasonal flu vaccinations may be established to simplify the process to provide the most effective protection for the populations.', '\nThis trial will focus on characterizing immunogenicity in a cohort of older adults above the age of 65, compared to a cohort of younger adults aged between 18 to 45.', '\nLet me now turn to a topic that currently and significantly influences the context and the cause of almost every COVID-19 clinical trial.', '\nWe thus believe that the potential to evade an existing immunity leads to an impairment of vaccine efficacy, although the true impact needs to be better understood.', '\nOn the next slide, I will go into detail of how we plan to address this additional complexity.', '\nWe will take the contribution of these strains to our COVID-19 cases into account when interpreting the results of our trials.', '\nThe combination of decentralized manufacturing and of approximately 1 to 3 grams of vaccine per week to be produced and cloud-based connectivity for rapid exchange of data and protocol positions, positions the RNA Printer as an ideal system for future pandemic preparedness and containment directly at the outbreak site.', '\nIn addition, we are under final discussions with the U.', '\nOpposite this, our co-development partnership with GSK lays a strong foundation to create value also beyond the pandemic.', '\nAs I mentioned briefly before, we are currently in a final negotiation stage of an R&D collaboration agreement with the U.', '\nIn return, CureVac would tech transfer its manufacturing process for the manufacturing of 50 million vaccine dosages in the U.', '\nHopp for EUR 100 million.', '\nAll of this is partially offset by third-party related costs.', '\nThe underwriters fully exercised their options to purchase the additional 750,000 common shares, which resulted in a total gross proceed of approximately USD 517.', '\nThis decrease was mainly due to lower sales following the termination of the Eli Lilly agreement in June 2020.', '\nAs a result, we recognized a full deferred revenue amount of EUR 33.', '\nFor the 12 months of 2020, we posted an operating loss of EUR 109.', '\nIn the 12 months of 2020, we recorded a loss before tax of EUR 129.', '\nWe are expecting important data readouts from our late-stage clinical trials in the coming weeks and we believe that they will allow us to seek regulatory approval in the second quarter of this year.', '\nWe closed 2020 with a very favorable cash position of EUR 1.', '\nYou know, which one should we expect to read out first?', '\nFranz Haas -- Chief Executive Officer\nOK.', '\nAspen Mori -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nWhich what we saw on the basis of our Phase 1 COVID trial and 2a so far is -- was very convincing also for GSK to say, well, this is really nice what we see based on the other activities we had to say, well, can we not base here on the second generation, something more on a multivalent kind of development, including certainly combo products with other pathogens.', '\nAspen Mori -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nSerra Goudarzi -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nHow would you plan to use that cash for further development of the company?', '\nSo basically, the EUR 450 million is a share of the price of the vaccine and the way it works is, that as we filed, there will be another milestone.', ""\nThere's a bit of dollars, there's a bit of euros, and there's also a little bit of spend in the first quarter."", ""\nSo we will need to have bigger clinical teams, we'll need to have bigger regulatory teams, we will have to beef up our, I would say, disease area teams, etc."", '\nMariola Fotin-Mleczek -- Chief Technology Officer\nYeah, I can comment on this.', '\nSeamus Fernandez -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst\nOK.', ""\nI think the situation is more contrasted in South America, where you don't always have super up-to-date data, and I think the trial will prove, will bring us a lot of information when the cases will be sequenced."", '\nSeamus Fernandez -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nFirst is really -- it seems like there are second-gen evolutions of the vaccine programs in RSV, in particular, at some competitors that are showing meaningful changes

"""\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Third Quarter 2020 ACCO Brands Corporation's Earnings Conference Call."", '\nAnd I will now hand the conference over to your speaker today, Christine Hanneman.', '\nAmong the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, are the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, government actions and third party responses to it and the consequences for the global economy, as well as the regional and local economies in which we operate, uncertainties regarding how geographies, distribution channels, and consumer behavior will evolve over time in response to the pandemic, and its impact on our business operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.', '\nPlease refer to our earnings release and SEC filings for an explanation of certain of these risk factors and assumptions.', '\nNow I will turn the call over to Boris Elisman.', ""\nI'm very pleased with our third quarter results."", '\nWhile the economic environment improved in the third quarter compared with the second quarter, we are still in the middle of the worst recession of our lifetimes, with demand for our products being impacted in many geographies by remote education, working from home, high unemployment, and low business confidence.', '\nThe parts of our product

holds, but are subject to several risks and uncertainties, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic.', ""\nAs shown on Slide 3, on today's call, we have Lisa Grow, IDACORP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Keen, IDACORP's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer."", '\nSlide 4 shows our quarterly and full-year financial results.', '\nThese, of course, are our estimates as of today, and those estimates assume normal weather conditions over the balance of the year and includes customer usage returning closer to pre-COVID-19 levels as we progress through the year.', '\nLisa A.', '\nIn addition to outstanding operating results, I am happy to report that IDACORP marked its 13th consecutive year of growth in earnings per share, as detailed on Slide 7.', '\nIDACORP and Idaho Power continue to benefit from strong customer growth and effective cost management, allowing us to preserve the full $45 million of additional accumulated deferred income -- investment tax credits for future earning support.', ""\nWe're pleased to continue to share the successes of the company with our owners by increasing IDACORP's quarterly common stock dividend again in 2020 from $0."", ""\nAs noted on Slide 8, Idaho Power's service area continues to experience substantial customer growth."", '\nIdaho Power now serves more than 587,000 customers and we view the reliable, affordable, clean energy our company provides as an important factor in continuing to attract the business and residential customers to Southern Idaho and Eastern Oregon.', ""\nAs outlined on Slide 10, IDACORP continues its strategy into 2021, starting toward our cornerstone goals of growing financial strength, improving the core business, enhancing Idaho Power's brand and keeping employees safe and engaged."", ""\nSignificant steps in 2020 include filing a supplement to Idaho Power's final license application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or FERC and preparing draft biological assessments in consultation with the U."", '\nThe FERC can issue the license as early as 2022 but as of today, we believe issuance is more likely in 2023 or thereafter.', '\nLast quarter, we stated Idaho Power did not plan to file a general rate case in Idaho or Oregon in the next 12 months.', ""\nAs part of our overall regulatory strategy, I'll highlight that Idaho Power filed an application last month with the Idaho Public Utilities Commission, requesting authorization to defer the Idaho portion of O&M expenses, including insurance cost and depreciation expense of certain capital investments expected to be necessary to implement its recently enhanced Wildfire Mitigation Plan or WMP."", '\nThis WMP outlines actions Idaho Power is taking or plans to implement in the future to reduce wildfire risk and to strengthen the resiliency of its transmission and distribution systems to wildfire.', ""\nNext, I'd like to highlight our newest Board member, Dr."", '\nAs a reminder, our power cost adjustment mechanisms in Idaho and Oregon significantly reduce earnings volatility related to changes in our resource mix and associated power supply costs that can fluctuate greatly due to weather.', ""\nWith that, I will hand things over to Steve for an overview of last year's financial performance."", '\nSteven R.', '\nFirst up on the table is our strengthening customer growth of 2.', '\nIrrigation sales volumes benefited from a return to more normal spring precipitation levels over 2019.', '\nNext, changes in net power supply expenses led to a $2.', '\nNext on the table, other operating and maintenance expenses decreased by $3.', '\nIn prior quarters, we mentioned a small deferral of expenses related to COVID-19.', '\nFinally, our higher pre-tax earnings led to an increase in income tax expense of $2.', '\nIDACORP and Idaho Power continue to maintain strong balance sheets, including investment grade credit ratings and sound liquidity, which enable us to fund ongoing capital expenditures and distribute dividend to shareowners.', ""\nIDACORP's operating cash flows along with our liquidity positions as of the end of 2020 are included on Slide 14."", '\nWhile cash flows have been minimally affected by the pandemic thus far, our combined liquidity along with expected regulatory support from our annual adjustment mechanisms is a substantial backup -- backed up to our expected capital and operating needs.', '\nSlide 15 shows our initiated full year 2021 earnings guidance and our key financial and operating metrics estimates.', '\nOur full year O&M expense guidance is expected to be in the range of $345 million to $355 million.', ""\nOn the subject of capex, turning to Slide 16, you'll note that the current five-year capital plan reflects significant

the pandemic and social unrest and the economic situation and certainly they have turned out better than we thought, although I certainly don't want to downplay any of the tragic impacts that have happened because of those."", '\nSteven R.', ""\nYeah, and Julien, I might just throw in, there's not a massive number of year-over-year items to think about, but we did talk about last -- in our second quarter, I think we brought it up, but we had about a $3 million O&M savings last year that was really our partners at the, I think Jim Bridger plant, with our coal plant."", ""\nThat was an unusual drop that we're not necessarily expecting a boomerang this year, but we do think this year goes back to a normal level."", ""\nAnd so, we've set the numbers above what we had last year, pretty well above our opening plan last year."", '\nSteven R.', ""\nIn our charts we'll be putting out, it really wasn't related to the 2020 year, so we didn't overload this chart with that, but those longer plans are still there in terms of what we see as opportunity."", '\nLisa A.', ""\nYeah, and that's -- I would add just that exactly that we do have -- we are -- none of this stuff happens in a step function."", '\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nAnd final quick question, I apologize.', '\nSteven R.', '\nYeah, I guess, I would just say that I think there is a bit of a requirement.', '\nLisa A.', '\nSteven R.', '\nBut that can change and I think as we saw this year, there was definitely a bit of a response to what people were experiencing in the states around us, that some just picked up and came.', '\nLisa A.', '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Chris Ellinghaus with Siebert Williams.', '\nLisa A.', '\nLisa A.', '\nI would say, getting that -- the permit finalized in 2022 is probably the next big -- the big date for that.', '\nAdam J.', '\nNo, I agree.', '\nLisa A.', ""\nWell, we're waiting -- just getting started actually for our next generation of our IRP process and that's really where we explore all of that."", ""\nSo I think as the Biden administration launches their plan, we'll be more -- where the R&D dollars go, what kind of resources are explored there and you kind of look at what's happening down in Texas, for example, I think that's going to give everybody pause and should as how fast you go, in what resources you go to, although I'm not suggesting it with the clean resources that are the problem, it was all the resources that froze up in this circumstance."", '\nLisa A.', ""\nBut we do see some that's -- I think they call themselves political refugees, they're sort of getting away from something and coming here."", '\nLisa A.', '\nSteven R.', ""\nNo, I think it's -- there is a story that I was just

in and construct and all that, but where we really saw it was I think the residential side had a growth impact, no question.', ""\nSo I think we did see that -- some of that residential uptick is -- it's a blend of the people that stay home and the new homes that came online and started using more power."", '\nLisa A.', ""\nYeah, and to add on to that, the costs were already committed to prior to the pandemic settling in, so the farmers, they're already in so."", '\nSteven R.', '\nLisa A.', '\nSteven R.', ""\nNo, I -- yeah, you're pointing out a really good point, Brian."", ""\nReally just

detail."", ""\nThe second quarter of fiscal-year 2020 was the first full quarter in which Newmar's luxury Motorhome line was included in our world-class portfolio."", '\nOur ability to sell products at attractive margins and continued low levels of discounting seen across the RV industry contributed to our profitability performance in the quarter and continues to reinforce our brand strength with dealers and end consumers.', '\nOur Q2 results demonstrate that supply network is assisting an incredible year-over-year production volume increase.', '\nThat revenue opportunity remains inherent in our potential as we transition into quarter 3.', '\nAs we continue to persevere and grow our business, we have also made it a priority to enhance and advance our corporate responsibility efforts and ensure that our company has the resources, infrastructure, and commitment to be a valued partner to the communities in which Winnebago Industries stakeholders live, work and play.', '\nWe achieved another period of very strong profitability in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.', '\nAdjusted earnings per diluted share were likewise a record at $2.', '\nRevenues for the Towable segment were $439.', ""\nNext, let's turn to our Motorhome segment."", '\nSimilar to last quarter, our Newmar business continues to be challenged by supply issues that are more pronounced relative to our other RV businesses due to the more specialized supplier base that serves this high-end business unit.', '\nWhile we continue to anticipate inflationary pressures and remain conscious of competition that may impact our net pricing equation, as well as continued supply chain challenges, we are encouraged by another quarter of sustained improvements to our margin in this segment.', '\nContinuing the trend from Q1, our leverage ratio, net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA continued to decline and is now 1.', '\nOur effective tax rate increased to 23.', '\nBut quarter 4 for our organization, June through August, industry retail will see a more challenging comparison environment due to record-breaking bounce-back RV retail last summer.', '\nDepending on the brand or the product category, field inventory is anywhere between 20% lower than a year ago to 60% lower.', '\nMultiple eight figures of capital is being invested currently and will likely continue well into fiscal-year 2022, and our financial results should gradually show the benefit of these investments each quarter.', '\nScott Stember -- C.', '\nScott Stember -- C.', ""\nThat's not to say they're exclusively in Newmar, but most of the

consumers and our dealers for several months now.', '\nScott Stember -- C.', ""\nMix, when you're looking at a dollar impact, not as big of a driver, right?"", '\nAnd that we expect notable

teams as desired.', '\nGerrick Johnson -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGreat.', '\nBut I would tell you, we are pleased with our motorized chassis suppliers, generally, with how they have worked hard to keep up with increasing demand, both within the Winnebago, but also the Newmar brands.', '\nWe have not seen a significant impact to our chassis because of that specific issue.', '\nGerrick Johnson -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOK.', ""\nYou're talking about price increases that cover inputs and the strong demand."", '\nI will tell you, as our teams are turning toward model-year 2022, some businesses are starting that transition and other businesses are a couple of months away from that, that they are discussing pricing changes that are probably somewhere in those low single digits.', '\nGerrick Johnson -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOK, great.', '\nBut I believe you are seeing a trend on profitability, Mike, that we believe is sustainable.', '\nMike Swartz -- Truist Securities -- Analyst\nOK, great.', '\nBut do you think that Winnebago or the industry has enough inventory or production capacity to positively comp retail in your fiscal fourth quarter if demand is there?', '\nAnd to your point, do we have lower inventory levels this year than last year?', '\nBut I think it will also depend on other conditions around consumer confidence and the state of the virus and all of that.', '\nIf I had to be a betting person today, I would tell you that I think that retail estimate is probably trending toward the higher side of our comment this morning.', ""\nSo I hope it's conservative."", '\nYou touched on some of the capacity expansion efforts that you guys are investing in, but you do have a fair amount of access to cash.', ""\nBut for now, we really haven't adjusted our capital allocation strategy."", '\nSo both are contributing to our top line, as well as our margin story in the quarter.', '\nMark Jordan -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nOperator\nOur next question comes from David Whiston with Morningstar.', '\nDavid Whiston -- Morningstar -- Analyst\nDo you get any indication -- you mentioned your good relationship with the suppliers earlier, do you get any indication that the light vehicle industry serving the GM, Ford, Toyotas of the world gets priority over the RV industry?', '\nMichael Happe -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI would not describe it as parity.', '\nBut they are constantly in communication, it appears, as to the allocation of manufacturing capacity and engineering resources and capital in terms of manufacturing.', '\nDavid Whiston -- Morningstar -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nBut in other parts of our business, more so in the verticals, we do see second shifts in order to allow us to keep up for demand.', '\nJust one final question for me on buybacks.', '\nIn other words, feeding the organic growth.', '\nDavid Whiston -- Morningstar -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nShawn Collins -- Citi -- Analyst\nHey, my question is on consumer demand and interest rates.', '\nMichael Happe -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, great question.', ""\nThe price of gasoline has always been something the industry's watched."", '\nWe believe that consumer demand is strong enough right now to withstand some elasticity in pricing, in gasoline, and in interest rates.', ""\nAnd so again, we think it's a majority of units that are usually subsidized or financed through some debt mechanism, but it's difficult to see."", ""\nAnd just if we think about what looks like 30%-plus retail growth in your fiscal year to date so far and I think given the easier comparisons, it sounds like, if anything, that's probably going to accelerate in your third quarter."", '\nAnd so our own retail performance, and you can do the math between quarter 1 and quarter 2 with the shipments in the field inventory, continues to remain strong and in most cases, running above the industry retail rate.', '\nSo I apologize.', ""\nBryan Hughes -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, let me pile on to that, well, James, if I may, because there's been a couple of people that have asked this question and I don't think we mean to infer at all that we're becoming a little bit bearish in Q4 as you might run your numbers as to how we feel about the sustainability of the retail pool."", '\nI

deserve.', '\nThrough scaling our data sets and improving pricing algorithms, we have been able to better segment our risks, resulting in increasing retention among the best 25% of drivers, while simultaneously decreasing the worst 25% of drivers that renew.', '\nThrough our data science capabilities, we were able to move from research to filing in less than two months, an effort that takes most competitors in excess of a year.', '\nAcross virtually all of our digital ad channels, we saw placement costs increased substantially, which has since become a documented trend across the entire consumer product landscape.', '\nBroadening our approach to customer acquisition channels is critical for us to manage your capital over the long term.', ""\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Dan."", '\nOn the top line, we grew direct written premium 24% year over year to $177 million.', '\nDirect accident period loss ratio was 88% for the second quarter, a 22% increase year over year against Q2 2020 when compared with the low loss environment in the previous year during the pandemic.', '\nDirect contribution was a $4 million loss for the quarter.', '\nAdditionally, we believe the prior rate increases taken as we saw these trends emerging will continue to earn into the book.', '\nThe actions we are taking on both the marketing and partnership fronts not only better position the company for sustained growth, but open channels to more efficiently deploy your capital and strengthen our liquidity position over the long term.', '\nWe therefore expect to significantly reallocate and reduce our current marketing spend, impacting near-term growth, but positioning us for higher and more efficient growth into the future.', '\nLooking ahead to 2022, we currently expect declines in

first question, Nick, and then turn it over to Alex.', '\nOperator\nOur next question is from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays.', '\nTracy Benguigui -- Barclays Investment Bank -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nAs we look out over the next six months, I think that we will end up being able to do more rate increases than what most of the competitors will be able to do.', '\nTracy Benguigui -- Barclays Investment Bank -- Analyst\nOK.', ""\nAnd so we think that we'll be -- and given the fact that we took smaller rate increases in first and second quarter, as we're coming back in, in the third and fourth

cohort-based treaties."", ""\nJosh Shanker -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nAnd on your growth guidance, I know you don't want to talk about the Carvana product yet because it's still in

Motemaden -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGreat.', '\nOperator\nOur next question is from Gary Ransom from Dowling and Partners.', '\nWere there some sales through the partnership?', '\nGary Ransom -- Dowling and Partners -- Analyst\nAnd one other question on retention.', '\nOperator\nOur next question is from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous.', ""\nSo I'm wondering, why is there not more of a benefit there?"", '\nSo as we assessed our channels and really decided to make a move to focus on making sure our capital is being invested in the channels that are working and turning off the ones that are not, it just takes a little bit of transition time to do that.', '\nOperator\nAnd our next question is from Christopher Martin from KBW.', '\nChristopher Martin -- KBW -- Analyst\nHey, guys.',

mentioned in G&A related to credit deterioration, is there a chance you could tell us the amount of that provision and do you expect to have to do this again in the second quarter?"", ""\nAnd then for

convinced for a while that those trends will play out in the long-term."", ""\nRuth Porat -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd then in terms of the geographic breakdown for YouTube, we haven't broken that down although I think as you know well, we have a breakdown for the major regions around the world and to give you a little more color there, in mid-February, revenue growth across the business began to decelerate in APAC, although as I noted, the decline in APAC was more muted just given the uneven impact of COVID and the nature of our business across the region and then the impact in EMEA was first evident in mid-February with a steeper fall off in March and in the second week of March, we then saw results in the U."", '\nSundar Pichai -- Chief Executive Officer\nMaybe I can give color both on the SMB and a bit on the ad side too.', ""\nOn the ad side, to your question about, maybe I can give more qualitative cover to what was said earlier and we -- the good thing about Search Ads and direct response on YouTube as well, but Search primarily is that it's an extraordinarily effective system, it's a transparent system."", '\nSundar Pichai -- Chief Executive Officer\nMaybe -- we have had tremendous momentum on G Suite and if all of Google works this way, products like Gmail, Google Docs were built from the ground up to really help people be productive and collaborative in a distributed work environment and so we are clearly seeing traction there.', '\nDan Salmon -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGood afternoon everyone.', ""\nAnd then a related follow up for Ruth, same question essentially, but as we think about the financial impact of such a change, imagine this is one of those things, which may qualify as causing maybe some variability in the quarter-to-quarter rate, but something that benefits all parties over the long-term, I think is how we've often visited these sorts of changes, but any color you could add on sort of the near and long-term impact of the Google Shopping changes would be great too?"", ""\nRuth Porat -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd in terms of your question about the financial implications of the effort, there's really not much to add here today I would just say, reecho Sundar's comment works, excited to have Bill leading the effort, and as Sundar said at the outset, one of the priorities is creating sustainable financial value and we have a leader who has a demonstrated track record of doing that."", '\nDan Salmon -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOkay, thank you both.', '\nSundar Pichai -- Chief Executive Officer\nOverall on cloud the interest and the momentum remains strong.', '\nSo just to add one more example, Cambridge Health Alliance is a U.', '\nKevin Rippey -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nHi, thanks for taking the question guys.', '\nSundar Pichai -- Chief Executive Officer\nMaybe stepping back, I would say, we are overall seeing strong momentum on YouTube.', '\nOur sales teams are doing an excellent job of helping our customers understand the opportunities there and so being able to bring all of that to bear.', '\nRuth Porat -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd then on your second question on capital returns, we believe a share purchase program for us appropriately sized is responsible in the current environment based on our capital allocation framework and our cash balance.', '\nOperator\nThank you and our final question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC.', '\nMark Mahaney -- RBC -- Analyst\nOkay, thanks.', '\nAnd then, secondly, the YouTube result in the March quarter was phenomenally strong given what happened in the month of March to YouTube.', ""\nRuth Porat -- Chief Financial Officer\nSo as I tried to be really clear in my response to Heather's question, I would not extrapolate from my comments for the full quarter."", '\nSundar Pichai -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, maybe just reiterate what was said earlier and I said that Search tends to -- people

"""\nKevin Kessel -- Vice President of Investor Relations\nThank you, and welcome to KLA's fiscal Q2 2021 quarterly earnings call to discuss the results of the December quarter and the outlook for the March quarter."", ""\nToday's discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified."", '\nPlease note all references are for the calendar year.', '\nRick Wallace -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Kevin, and thank you for joining us today and for your interest in KLA.', '\nAnd while our teams have not been physically together for the most part, our company continues to demonstrate the great KLA culture of collaboration and innovation and is emerging stronger than ever.', '\nWe delivered strong growth, profitability and free cash flow while continuously adjusting to the changing work environments driven by COVID.', '\nWe also delivered notable profitability growth with non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP earnings per share increasing 28% and 32%, respectively year over year.', '\nAnd given the accelerated growth of our served markets, we remain solidly on track to meet and likely exceed our 2023 financial targets.', '\nThis digital transformation is enabling secular demand drivers such as high-performance computing, artificial intelligence and rapid growth in new automotive electronics and 5G communications markets.', '\nKLA operating model is the enduring framework that we rely on to guide the execution of our long-term strategic objectives.', '\nAs expected, memory demand also grew as memory customers plan for growth and equipment investment in 2021 to meet improving end demand.', '\nFueled by expanded customer investment in EUV lithography, the Semiconductor Process Control business is driving adoption with new applications in optical inspection portfolio, such as EUV print check for GEN5, and expanding our share in new markets for KLA, including the eSL10 e-beam inspection Platform and the nascent use of x-ray technologies for metrology applications.', '\nWorking in close collaboration with customers and partners, the Services business innovated and drove new initiatives against the unprecedented challenges of COVID.', '\nRevenue growth was strong, and we believe that on a net basis will exceed our $50 million annual acquisition cost synergy target by at least another additional $30 million.', '\nFinally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders, in the December quarter, we repurchased $177 million of common stock and paid $140 million in dividends.', ""\nBefore Bren gets into the greater detail of our financial highlights, let me briefly summarize, despite the disruption and unforeseen challenges that persisted throughout the year associated with COVID, KLA has benefited from the resourcefulness of its global workforce, we've adapted well and we end 2020 in a position of strength while delivering record results and set the stage for the sixth consecutive year of growth."", '\nAt the same time, our strategy of driving diversified growth with strong long-term operating leverage should provide consistent capital returns to our shareholders.', '\nAll of this was accomplished while simultaneously continuing to return high levels of capital to shareholders.', '\nGAAP EPS was $2.', '\nThe higher operating expenses in the quarter were due in part to adjustments in variable compensation programs as well as the timing of prototype material purchases for product development programs.', '\nThough we always have some variability in our tax rate, given the timing and impact of discrete items and the geographic distribution of revenue and profit, we believe it is prudent to adjust our long-term tax planning rate up slightly to 13.', '\nOur segment revenue was strong in the quarter, driven by growth in our Semiconductor Process Control business.', '\nWithin memory, the business was roughly 60% NAND and 40% DRAM.', '\nPCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was $179 million, down 1% sequentially, but up 12% for 2020 as strength in PCB and component inspection offset a weaker business environment in the display business.', '\nWe believe our track record for delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders.', '\nAs a result, we would expect the company revenue to be roughly consistent quarter to quarter across the year.', '\nWe forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61.', '\nFinally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.', ""\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to begin the Q&A."", ""\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions We'll now take our first question from Patrick Ho with Stifel."", '\nAnd NAND flash has obviously seen intensity rise with the increasing layer counts.', '\nBut on the KLA side, one of the areas where you could argue that we -- I think we do something in our business to support, and I think we get paid for it in terms of our profitability, but to support our model, both in terms of the component differentiation we have that drives our differentiation of our products, but also that enables our business.', '\nAnd given the strength of the service business, we tend to move the part.', ""\nIt's -- this is not a turns business for the most part, so I think there's probably an upper limit to it."", ""\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo."", '\nAnd as I said in the prepared remarks, it looks relatively consistent.', '\nBut what I wanted to do is provide a little bit more context.', '\nAnd I think starting with the backlog we have, the visibility we have in the funnel and then just the general lead time dynamics of our products, it gives me some comfort with that statement.', '\nJoe Quatrochi -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\nOK.', ""\nSo I was curious, how do you think about opportunities to maybe even spend a little bit more and accelerate some of the product development projects you've got going on?"", ""\nAnd so I think the gross margin is reflective of the differentiation that we have with our products in the field and I think the value we're adding to our customers."", ""\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from CJ Muse with Evercore."", '\nCJ Muse -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nYeah.', '\nIs that impacting GEN5 optical demand at all?', '\nRick Wallace -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes, CJ.', ""\nThe first one, no, we don't see any slowdown in the EUV impact if the delays that were outlined by ASML in terms of the demand for GEN5."", '\nWe do see continued growth in that business.', ""\nThis is a little bit newer for us to understand the dynamics of the Orbotech business, but we feel good about the signs that we're seeing."", ""\nBren Higgins -- Chief Financial Officer\nSo CJ, the only thing that I'll add to that is we were guiding it right."", ""\nSo while the display business is, I expect a down year in '21 versus '20, the other businesses are more than making up for it."", '\nCJ Muse -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nThank you.', ""\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse."", ""\nAnd as I look at the next several quarters and why I put the comments in the prepared remarks that I feel like we're operating in the 61."", '\nAnd so the volume considerations associated with capex impact us less than that.', '\nBren Higgins -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, John, it was fairly weak for most of 2020, and we saw this increase in the December quarter which had some breadth to it, and we expected to see that.', ""\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company."", '\nDo you think that exposure or process control intensity increases in DRAM as DRAM goes more EUV?', ""\nI think the intensity at this point is slightly higher in the NAND than in the DRAM, but they're both kind of increasing at similar amounts."", ""\nBren Higgins -- Chief Financial Officer\nKrish, the only thing I would add on DRAM is with the introduction of EUV, and we'll have to see how that plays out, it does drive some infrastructure."", ""\nAnd I'd argue that, certainly, the increase in demand we've seen on the Systems side gives us a tailwind to that growth rate moving forward."", ""\nSo I keep thinking, look, 80%, 85%, I think that's probably reasonable to think that we could aspire to get there."", ""\nRick Wallace -- Chief Executive Officer\nJust to add to it, I mean, the one other factor is the tools that are being shipped today, the complexity is such that if you think about a car analogy, it's pretty hard to service a car today."", ""\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America."", '\nVivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nThanks for taking my question.', '\nLike, what would help you grow above or below WFE this year?', ""\nBren Higgins -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, when I look at it, Vivek, I think that there's -- you have a little bit more memory investment this year than in '20."", ""\nI would expect that we'll probably do a little bit better."", ""\nSo I would think KLA's share of WFE is probably flat to slightly up as we look at '21 from where we sit today."", ""\nSo I'm curious, how are you looking at cash returns going forward if you're going to have such strong growth this year and the longer-term trends are there, why not look at 100% free cash flow returns and looking at boosting dividends or the buyback?"", ""\nBren Higgins -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, so if you go back to Investor Day, and I think even over time, every

productively."", ""\nBut you're right, given the growth of the business, I would expect that we can deploy more."", ""\nAnd given the uptick in the business that we're describing, I would expect our quarter-to-quarter share repurchasing to increase as we go forward here."", ""\nSo that's our model, and we do our exercise here each year, and we'll continue to do it that way."", ""\nOperator\nWe'll

"'\nOperator\nGreetings, and welcome to the Floor & Decor Holdings second-quarter call.', ""\nThe company's actual future results could differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements for any reason, including those listed in its SEC filings."", '\nWe believe non-GAAP disclosures enable investors to better understand our core operating performance on a comparable basis between periods.', '\nTom Taylor -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Wayne, and thanks to everyone for joining us on our second-quarter 2019 earnings conference call.', '\nComparable store sales grew 3% and were up 14.', '\nOur adjusted second-quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.', '\nNew stores contributed to our better-than-expected second-quarter total sales growth and year-over-year improvement in our new store productivity.', '\nThe majority of the remaining third-quarter openings are expected to be in September.', '\nAs a reminder, the 109 stores that we currently operate represent only a fraction of our potential U.', '\nOur second-quarter comparable store sales growth of 3% was at the high end of our expectations of 1 to 3% growth.', '\nSecond-quarter comparable store transactions, one measure of market share growth, increased 1.', '\nWe continue to be very pleased with the sales growth and attachment rates that we are experiencing in our higher-margin installation accessories categories.', '\nIn the second quarter, we have begun testing vanities and vanity tops, as well as bath accessories.', '\nOur second-quarter e-commerce sales increased 60% from last year and accounted for 10% of our tendered sales, compared with 8% at the end of 2018.', ""\nWe continue to see increased customers' e-commerce engagement with tools like My Order, which allows us to work with a customer to build their order in our aisle on a mobile device so that they can buy that day and get on their way quicker or email them the details so that they can think about it or change products and ultimately tend to them when they are ready."", '\nA crucial tool that we launched in the third quarter of 2018 is our pro premier loyalty program, along with an umbrella of needed business service offerings.', '\nIn stores where pro premier engagement and redemption is highest, we see higher comparable store sales growth, compared with stores that are not as far along in the development of their program.', ""\nOver the last 90 days, we've seen substantial increases from last years, and we expect usage to continue to grow as we further build out awareness, features and functionality, including schedule and pro check-in."", '\nWe believe these are primarily new incremental sales from business customers that likely have not historically bought from retail, thereby opening a large segment of commercial flooring up to us.', '\nWe believe we can lower our China-sourced tile exposure to the low single-digit range as a percentage of total sales by the end of 2019 due to the early actions we have taken in moving sourcing to other countries.', '\nWe have positioned our inventory receipt flow around these timelines and believe our strategies will help mitigate these potential cost increases.', '\nThat said, we have company-specific drivers that we believe will sequentially accelerate our comparable store sales growth in the second half of 2019.', '\nThe improved product margins were due to favorable negotiations with our suppliers, improved merchandising strategies, including higher sales from our higher-margin installation accessories, and some strategic retail price increases.', ""\nOur new stores' selling and operating expenses as a percentage of sales are approximately 50% more than those opened greater than one year, and this resulted in near-term operating expenses de-leverage."", '\nWe opened three new stores and relocated one store this year, compared with four new store openings last year.', '\nOur second-quarter adjusted net income increased 24.', '\nWe ended the second quarter with 104,800,000 diluted weighted average shares outstanding, compared with 104,900,000 last year.', '\nMoving on to our second-quarter balance sheet.', ""\nThis will reflect the inventory build to support 20 new stores; more new store openings in early 2020; our new Baltimore, DC, that's planned to open in the fourth quarter; 25% tariffs on Chinese imports; and further improving our merchandise in-stock positions."", '\nAs you saw in our press release, we are updating our 2019 sales and earnings outlook to reflect the second-quarter results and changes in our outlook from import tariffs imposed on products sourced from China.', ""\nTrade Representative's Office took action to institute a 25% duty rate at the U."", ""\nI think it's important to point out that our pricing philosophy and strategy has maintained -- to maintain our industry-leading-everyday low-price strategy has not changed."", '\nAlso as discussed on the last two calls, the implementation of higher tariffs will modestly lower our gross margin expectations as we intend to only pass along the incremental cost we incur versus making a margin on the new tariffs.', '\nExcluding the estimated costs associated with our relocation to our new store support center, we expect our operating margin to be approximately 7%.', '\nTurning to our full-year outlook.', '\nAssuming we achieved our full-year comparable store sales growth expectation, we are proud to be able to accomplish this above-industry growth rates yet again in the most challenging housing environment in a decade.', '\nMoving to our full-year SG&A expense.', '\nAs a reminder, this guidance does not consider the tax benefit due to the impact of stock option exercises that may occur in fiscal 2019.', '\nTom Taylor -- Chief Executive Officer\nI am proud of how we performed in early 2019, and we are planning for another successful year.', '\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions Our first question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.', '\nAnd maybe can you speak to the underlying run rate of the business.', ""\nTom Taylor -- Chief Executive Officer\nI'll start."", '\nIt gave us the ability to clear more inventory pre-tariffs, and our vendors did a better job at negotiating than we anticipated.', '\nOne other the thing I wanted to point out, when you look at the total sales guidance we gave for the year, we took out the total sales guidance more than the comp piece of it because of the performance of our new stores.', '\nSimeon Gutman -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nTom Taylor -- Chief Executive Officer\nSo I think there was two questions there, Lisa, you can answer them.', '\nOperator\nOur next question comes from John Baugh with Stifel.', '\nDo you have to take a price increase?', '\nAnd one other point we made this early in the year, just to make it again.', ""\nTom Taylor -- Chief Executive Officer\nI don't believe it's enough change in price to impact it."", '\nOperator\nNext question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS.', '\nMichael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst\nGood evening.', ""\nTom Taylor -- Chief Executive Officer\nI'll take a stab at that."", '\nMichael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst\nAnd so, now looking forward, have you assumed that the market is going to improve from here?', '\nTom Taylor -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, as I said in my comments at the end of my prepared remarks, we are cautiously optimistic that that rate cuts are going to help existing home sales and moderate them at best.', ""\nAnd so, if we do see a pickup in existing home sales turnover, we feel that's going to lead to some improvement from what we've seen for the last 18 months, where existing home sales have been declining."", ""\nMichael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst\nAnd with that being said, what's implied for the fourth quarter, is it pretty significant ramp in the same-store sales, looks around a 9% comp."", ""\nTom Taylor -- Chief Executive Officer\nI'll start, Trevor, you can weigh in too."", '\nThose are the main contributors to that much higher comp in the fourth quarter.', '\nMichael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst\nGot it.', '\nOperator\nNext question comes from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.', '\nI was just wondering if you could just hold our hand in the third quarter.', ""\nSo I think it has much more to do with that we had a bit of a pickup this last year, which was the other side of that because we didn't have a negative headwind in '18 has probably more to do with it than anything."", '\nChuck Grom -- Gordon Haskett -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nTom Taylor -- Chief Executive Officer\nI think we have gained market share over the last few months, a bit longer than that.', '\nOperator\nNext question comes from Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo.', ""\nOne is, last year, as soon as the tariffs came into place, again Lisa's team hustled up and got some vendor accommodations that benefited us."", '\nAnd then on top of that, we are going to have a modest headwind in the third quarter because of tariffs.', ""\nThat $5 million for the Baltimore DC, it's about 90 basis points."", '\nSo a lot of moving parts with DCs and tariffs and things like that coming in, but I think that reconciles it for each of the remaining two quarters.', ""\nTom Taylor -- Chief Executive Officer\nI think -- so I'll try to -- if I remember, you've mentioned a lot of them in this."", '\nThere does seem to be a consumer land on whether these items are -- price increases are accepted by consumers, and particularly for maybe considered purchase where bigger ticket consumers looking at the price for maybe a couple of weeks.', '\nPeter Keith -- Piper Jaffray -- Analyst\nOK.', ""\nYou guys, I'm sure, have researched every single great detail."", ""\nThat's the lower of the two."", ""\nSo let's -- I'm just picking a number."", '\nThat one usually is a vendor-specific rate.', '\nIt is possible that when they put those two rates in, the one in early September, the one in early November, countervailing and antidumping, they can retro it back 90 days.', ""\nPeter Keith -- Piper Jaffray -- Analyst\nOK, that's great."", '\nOperator\nNext question comes from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse.', '\nSeth Sigman -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nTom, early in the call, you mentioned that comps improved sequentially each month in the quarter.', '\nTrevor Lang -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nI think in the first -- this -- the comparisons in Houston have gotten easier.', '\nSo the only thing I would add to that is our comparisons got a little easier relative to the same time last year as well.', ""\nI'm just curious in light of all the sourcing changes, how do you feel about your inventory position today?"", '\nAnd we were always going to shoot for some better in-stocks so you will not see that level of inventory growth.', ""\nTom Taylor -- Chief Executive Officer\nI would say -- I'd a couple of more things on inventory."", ""\nWhen you have such broad assortment of in-stock product across every category, typically you can give something in the customer's hand before they leave the building."", '\nWe are at a really low level which helps our total inventory productivity.', '\nOperator\nNext question comes from Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities.', '\nAs you probably heard Tom say, 70% of our stores are opening in the back quarter of this year.', ""\nYou guys have heard us say it's starting really with the class of the '16 and more than doubled our first-year profit."", '\nWe are committed to our long-term growth goals, both from a top-line perspective and the mid- to low 20s and in earnings growth rate on our cadence business just staying above that.', ""\nSpecifically, though if you're talking about early next year, your thinking is correct."", '\nBut we feel good about our ability to our -- grow both our sales and earnings next year, even though we are going to take on additional costs for that Baltimore DC.', '\nBut we will be able to offset a good portion of that DC through lower domestic transportation cost.', '\nOperator\nOur final question comes from Seth Basham with the Wedbush Securities.', '\nSeth Basham -- Wedbush Securities -- Analyst\nMy first question is just one for clarification.', '\nTom Taylor -- Chief Executive Officer\nI appreciate all the questions today.', ""\nIt's a tough environment for flooring this year, and if you look for the second quarter, we're able to achieve all the high-ends of our guidance, what we thought we could achieve to be able to still grow at a 20% total top-line growth have taken end-transactions up within the quarter and avenues stores performing really well.""]"
"'\nI will devote my discussion to explanations of those results and to the balance sheet and cash flow items.', '\nAs usual, however, I must read the following.', '\nOne more recurring message, when we refer to our European-based operations, we are primarily talking about sales of Prestige Fragrance products conducted through our 73% owned French subsidiary, Interparfums SA.', '\nOur consolidated first quarter gross margin of 61.', '\nAs I turn the discussion to expenses, please keep in mind that our entire operational budget for the first quarter was based on our originally projected annual sales of $742 million.', '\nSo, for the first quarter, promotion and advertising included in SG&A expenses approximated 19.', '\nFor European operations, SG&A expenses declined 6.', ""\nThe first quarter story is one of significant erosion from the positive leverage that we've seen over the last couple of years."", '\nWe are looking for some improvement as the year unfolds, but until we see firm product orders, it is impossible to quantify.', '\nOn a related subject, you will see that our inventories at March 31 are relatively unchanged from year-end where there was little if anything being reported about COVID-19.', '\nNow, I will turn the call over to Jean for a closer look at how we are doing, what we are doing, and our expectations.', '\nMoving on to our market, as noted in the first quarter, the impact of COVID-19 was most severe in the Middle East and Asia, where net sales declined for us 44% in the Middle East and 37% in Asia, respectively, for the first quarter.', '\nIn North America and Western Europe, where shelter-in-place and store closings were implemented later in the period, first quarter net sales declined 21% in North America and 11% in Western Europe.', '\nOur consolidated sales for the month of April were down significantly.', '\nSeveral US states have also begun to restart with more coming on-board in the weeks and months ahead.', '\nEven with economies opening our expectations are restrained, and quite frankly, we expect near-term demand for fragrance to be considerably less than last year.', '\nSo before taking your questions, one thing is Russ and I want to extend our appreciation to all of our employees, as well as our suppliers, our distributors around the globe for their effort during this unprecedented period.', ""\nJean Madar -- Co-Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nIf you want I can add because I'm following this on a weekly basis, I get reports."", ""\nJean Madar -- Co-Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nLet's talk about the duty-free business."", '\nThe other territories, Europe, US will start recouping, we think in our projections we have starting the month of June, July, and August.', '\nJoe Altobello -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nAnd in terms of e-comm as a percentage of revenue?', '\nLinda Bolton-Weiser -- DA Davidson -- Analyst\nHi.', '\nLinda Bolton-Weiser -- DA Davidson -- Analyst\nGood, good.', ""\nRussell Greenberg -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWell, the -- first of all, there is a little bit in COGS, but it's almost inconsequential."", ""\nWhat we've done with respect to the fixed costs."", '\nLinda Bolton-Weiser -- DA Davidson -- Analyst\nAnd then, you commented on, like a down 50% number for retail store traffic.', ""\nRussell Greenberg -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nAs Jean mentioned, the 50%, I -- and Jean, correct me if I'm wrong because I don't want to put words in your mouth."", ""\nAgain this was in our projections, when we redid our projections in March for the rest of the year, we didn't expect sales in April, it is going to be a little bit better in May."", '\nLinda Bolton-Weiser -- DA Davidson -- Analyst\nThank you.', ""\nJean Madar -- Co-Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nHonestly, it's a very good question because I ask myself this question, because as you know me and Philippe, my partner, we receive 45% to 50% of the dividend."", '\nAgain, the dividend was not too much a cash flow thing because when we have I think $200 million, and again, but we think that it was not right to -- it was better to hold it.', '\nLinda Bolton-Weiser -- DA Davidson -- Analyst\nOkay.', '\nRussell Greenberg -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWe are working very closely with pretty much all of our customers because everybody is trying to push things out as much as they can due to the -- due to their own cash flow issues.', ""\nJean Madar -- Co-Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nAnd I'd like to add, if I may --\nWendy Nicholson -- Citigroup -- Analyst\nYeah."", '\nJean Madar -- Co-Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nI would like to add that either from our operations in Paris or in New York, most -- 99% of our receivables are covered by insurance.', '\nSo, yes, we have definitely little bit more inventory than we would like.', '\nJean Madar -- Co-Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nAnd we have been able to -- we -- yeah, and I will continue.', '\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Steph Wissink with Jefferies.', '\nRussell Greenberg -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWell, we were -- we have been working on quite a few different things prior to the pandemic coming out.',

"'\nIn addition, on this call, the company will make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, adjusted gross profit and adjusted EBITDA.', '\nIn conjunction with these actions, we reduced effective capacity in our US manufacturing facility by 50%.', '\nAs part of realignment of our North American operation earlier this year, our progress is evident from encouraging results in our core business in the US which grew 12% year-over-year.', ""\nThe impact was greater than it's anticipated and resulted in a softer than expected performance during the second quarter, while the expected benefits of our initiatives give us confident in achieving our full-year EBITDA outlook for 2019, we adjusted our expectations from revenue to reflect a more competitive environment than originally anticipated."", '\nIn conclusion, we are pleased with the overall progress that we saw in our initiatives during the second quarter.', '\nIn the United States, second quarter sales increased by 7% compared to the second quarter of 2018.', '\nAs a result of the tariffs, we have seen a surge in imports to the US from other developing countries in particular, India and Turkey.', '\nIn Canada, constant currency sales were down 11.', '\nIn Europe, constant currency sales grew 15.', '\nLooking at our second quarter P&L performance, adjusted gross margin was 27.', '\nAs we mentioned on our last earnings call, the second quarter of 2018 was our highest gross margin quarter in 2018, which we did not expect to repeat this quarter, primarily due to lower capacity utilization.', '\nMoving to our outlook, for the full year 2019, we reiterate our adjusted EBITDA outlook to be in the range of $72 million to $80 million while moderating our anticipated revenue to a range of $550 million to $565 million.', '\nAs a reminder, the financial impact of our global growth acceleration plan is included in our outlook for 2019 and is intended to drive additional growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA in the coming years.', '\nWe are encouraged that the actions we took in the second quarter have already yielded improvement in our margin and

growth acceleration plan, the headcount reduction, the reduction in capacity, all of those things were expected -- a part of the plan three months ago.', '\nYuval Dagim -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, so, first -- there are different dynamics here from FX rates to prices of raw materials, that also changed and provided some headwind, a tailwind.', '\nMichael Rehaut -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\nAny quantification on the raw material benefit this year relative to your outlook three months ago?', '\nYuval Dagim -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, I can say that -- if you look at it in

Zoom, you obviously raised your full-year operating margin guidance by a decent amount, you might see people apply that gap and raise their operating cash flow margin guidance or estimates as well.',

want to do more, especially the pre-events and post-events and how to run everything virtually online, like take Zoomtopia, for example, from the see the new plan in the Zoomtopia and all the way

volumes in our mill network, corrugated sheet and tube and core business."", '\nVolumes in core choice, our corrugated sheet feeder system, were up nearly 36% per day versus the prior-year quarter due to strong durables, e-commerce growth, auto supply chain and food and beverage demand.', '\nFirst-quarter adjusted EBITDA fell by roughly 6% versus the prior-year quarter.', '\nConsistent with prior years, first-quarter adjusted free cash flow was a cash outflow and was roughly flat to that prior year.', ""\nWe anticipate the paper business' second-quarter adjusted EBITDA to increase sequentially from Quarter 1 primarily due to continued strong volumes and the flow-through of announced price increases, partially offset by additional mill maintenance downtime."", '\nWe anticipate that interest expense will be in the range of $99 million to $104 million, or roughly $14 million lower year over year as a result of lower debt levels and the favorable rates we locked in on our term loan A3.', '\nWe anticipate working capital to be a cash use commensurate with our announced price increases and raw material inflation.', ""\nThe negative financial impact we've experienced from COVID, coupled with robust current timberland prices seen in the market, made this an opportunistic time to bring acreage to market."", '\nWe have a three-pronged capital deployment strategy focused on reinvesting

'\nPlease also note that we will discuss non-GAAP measures today which are more thoroughly explained and reconciled to the most comparable measures reported under the generally accepted accounting principles in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.', '\nZeng Xi -- Co-Chief Executive Officer\n[Foreign language\nWarren Wen -- Financial Controller\nHello, everyone, and welcome to our fourth-quarter 2020 earnings call and Mr.', '\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 also further accelerated the digitalization of various industries as more consumers moved online in general, the reliance on online sales channels from homebuyers have resulted in the rapid development of digital real estate transaction services.', '\nAccording to a report from CSC Financial, the average commission rate for the resale property has remained below 2% for the past two years.', '\nAdditionally, we also witnessed the unpresent -- the unprecedented competition in the sector during the year.', '\nAnd with that, I will now -- Mr.', '\nMore importantly, the number of active agents who act as our SaaS solution increased by 30.', '\nFor the full year of 2020, we provided services to 5,825 new construction property projects, representing a year-over-year increase of 24.', '\nAlthough our decision not to offer subsidies will have a short-term impact on our closed-loop transaction volume, we remain confident about our long-term growth prospects.', ""\nThis solution enables the developer to interact with the platform's most suitable agent and improve the developers' transaction efficiencies by digitalizing their sales cycle."", '\nBy providing more high-quality online property listings and enabling agencies to directly serve developers, this feature helps agencies to improve their customer conversion rate.', '\nDuring the fourth quarter, we established a strategic partnership with Centaline Property Agency which enabled us to further enhance our closed-loop retail property transaction capabilities.', '\nWe leverage our effective operations and sale support services to help developers monetizing -- monetize those parking spaces that typically have lower turnover rates.', '\nThis will accelerate the digitalization of agency operations which will improve the abilities of agencies to close deals on our platform and thus ramp up the revenue and profit growth of our new construction property transaction business.', '\nLastly, we plan to invest more in our resale property segment.', '\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Mr.', '\nPan Jiaorong -- Chief Financial Officer\nForeign language\nWarren Wen -- Financial Controller\nOK.', '\nAnd revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 -- uh, the course of revenue in the fourth-quarter 2020 decreased to RMB 570.', '\nSales and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter of 2020 increased to RMB 32.', ""\nTo a lesser extent, the decrease was also due to the company's decision to shift its focus to expanding the size of the product development team to optimizing operating efficiency, as well as, optimize its product development structure with a focus on the company's SaaS solution which lead to the decrease in the personnel-related expenses in the period."", '\nNet loss in the fourth quarter of 2020 were RMB 92.', '\nNow I will also briefly review our full-year results.', '\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2020 were RMB 301.', '\nFor the fourth quarter of 2020, net cash used in operating activity was RMB 225.', '\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\nOperator instructions We have a question coming from the line of Lisa Thompson from Zacks Investment.', '\nWarren Wen -- Financial Controller\nLet me translate your question first.', '\nLisa Thompson -- Zacks Investment Research -- Analyst\nThis year.', '\nWarren Wen -- Financial Controller\nThis year.', '\nZeng Xi -- Co-Chief Executive Officer\nForeign language\nWarren Wen -- Financial Controller\nSo to answer your first question, we will have two model coexist for the coming year -- for the year 2021.', '\nZeng Xi -- Co-Chief Executive Officer\nForeign language\nWarren Wen -- Financial Controller\nFor the product development expenses, we believe because our product development team is pretty much mature up to now and we believe the increase in percentage in comparison with 2020 were within 10% to 20%.', '\nLisa Thompson -- Zacks Investment Research -- Analyst\nDoes that add then to around the same amount as you spent in 2020 to be RMB 640 million?', '\nWarren Wen -- Financial Controller\nRMB 640 million, you mean -- what do you mean by 640 --\nLisa Thompson -- Zacks Investment Research -- Analyst\nTotal operating.', '\nWarren Wen -- Financial Controller\nTotal operating expenses.', '\nZeng Xi -- Co-Chief Executive Officer\nForeign language\nWarren Wen -- Financial Controller\nOK.', '\nLisa Thompson -- Zacks Investment Research -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nWarren Wen -- Financial Controller\nForeign language\nZeng Xi -- Co-Chief Executive Officer\nForeign language\nWarren Wen -- Financial Controller\nThe answer is really yes because we have launched the SaaS solution offering to our developer base with a much higher gross profit margin, as said before, and as far as the penetration rate and the percentage of this type of revenue increases for the years to come and we believe the overall gross profit margin will increase in the following quarter and years.', '\nZeng Xi -- Co-Chief Executive Officer\nForeign language\nWarren Wen -- Financial Controller\nAnd also to our traditional commission -- base commissioning revenue, we believe with the continued in-depth service to our developer base and our agent base, we also believe the gross profit margin as a percentage will continue to increase in the years to come.', '\nLisa Thompson -- Zacks Investment Research -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nWarren Wen -- Financial Controller\nForeign language\nZeng Xi -- Co-Chief Executive Officer\nForeign language\nWarren Wen -- Financial Controller\nOK.', ""\nZeng Xi -- Co-Chief Executive Officer\nForeign language\nWarren Wen -- Financial Controller\nAnd another point we have noticed is the local government, the Chinese government is controlling the selling price of the new construction property price and also the resale property price and so that developer's profit margin is dropping significantly."", '\nLisa Thompson -- Zacks Investment Research -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nWarren Wen -- Financial Controller\nOK.']"
"'\nOperator\nGood morning, and welcome to the Driven Brands first-quarter 2021 earnings conference call.', ""\nDuring today's call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures."", ""\nFactors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in the company's SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today, containing the company's earnings release."", '\nOur four operating segments provide diversification to our business model, diversity across our brands, geographies, and needs-based service categories.', '\nRevenue increased 83%.', '\nBut I would be remiss not to mention some discrete tailwinds in the quarter.', '\nThe overall strength and diversity of our business model, the inherent operating leverage in our business, and, of course, the power of our data analytics platform.', '\nWe drove more new and repeat customers to our shops, and this resulted in increased market share across all segments in Q1.', '\nWe remained open, staffed, and had inventory for our customers as they needed our services.', '\nYou can see this in our strong same-store sales in Q1 in both our maintenance and car wash segments.', '\nAnd maintaining best-in-class inventory levels, leveraging data and supply chain allowed franchisees within our platform services segment to continue to sell when many of our competitors could not.', '\nBullish about the impact of the reopening in the United States and the demand for our services for the remainder of 2021, 2022, and beyond, said simply, as consumers drive more, Driven wins.', '\nOur media shift led to an incremental 250,000 cars within the quarter.', '\nAnother differentiator for Driven Brands is the impact of data on unit growth.', '\nToday, we have more than 700 commitments to open franchise sites, which provides long-term visibility into unit growth for the next four years.', '\nWe grew revenue 83% versus prior year.', '\nAnd as we continue to grow same-store sales and add new units, we will generate a ton of cash.', '\nOur growth is low risk because of our current market share.', ""\nThis is what will drive Driven's long-term growth model: revenue growth at attractive consistent margins, which leads to adjusted EBITDA growth and significant cash generation."", '\nSystemwide sales were a record $1 billion in the first quarter, from which we generated revenue of $329 million, an increase an increase of 83% versus the prior year.', ""\nSince Q1 last year, we've added 1,157 net new stores."", '\nWe outpaced the industry across all business segments, continuing to gain market share as the reopening begins to take shape across many of the markets in which we operate.', '\nThis is all laid out in our infographic, which is posted on our IR website, and I encourage you to spend some time understanding the mix of our portfolio.', '\nThe flow-through of this model is powerful.', '\nAnd interest expense was $18 million in the quarter, effectively flat to last year.', '\nThe lower effective tax rate this quarter versus our expected annual effective tax rate was due to the impact of the loss on debt extinguishment.', '\nNow, a bit more color on our first-quarter results by segment.', '\nThe number of Wash Club members has grown by close to 50,000 in the first quarter.', ""\nBut as vehicle miles traveled accelerates, so too will the pace of this segment's recovery."", '\nThat portfolio has a weighted average fixed annual interest rate of 4% and a weighted average remaining term of six years.', '\nOur formula is simple: we add new stores, we grow same-store sales, and we deliver stable margins.', ""\nWe feel very good about the start to our year and don't have any reason to believe that our outperformance in Q1 is a pull-forward of demand from later in the year."", '\nWe still expect to open 160 to 190 net new stores across the portfolio, and we expect positive same-store sales growth across all of our segments.', '\nWe look forward to speaking with you again in late July when we release second-quarter results.', '\nIf you could just talk about how that trended through Q1 and if you could dissect it on -- you mentioned stimulus, the reopening, and miles-driven recovery, consumer confidence, your own share gains, if you can just kind of dissect how those interplayed and how you saw that play out through the quarter with the cadence of how trends went through Q1.', '\nTiffany Mason -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nHey, Michael, thanks for the question.', '\nAnd then in March, we had double-digit positive same-store sales overall as vaccine distribution picked up as consumer sentiment was improving and vehicle miles traveled was increasing.', '\nMarch is positive and certainly the strongest month of the quarter.', '\nAnd I mean how -- I guess you incorporated the improving trends into the raised guidance.', '\nWe have strong momentum in April, but I think we need to see Q2 play out before we feel good about giving you a new full-year outlook for 2021.', '\nAnd we want to stay focused, deliberate, and resolute as we finish out the second quarter.', '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Liz Suzuki with Bank of America.', '\nAnd I would include Canada in the northern markets.', '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with J.', '\nChris Horvers -- J.', '\nSo you talked about a number of positive factors, but you also had a couple of headwinds during the quarter in terms of the weather in Texas, in that region, in February.', ""\nAnd so when I said the February comp was the weakest of the three months, that's partly why that is the trend."", '\nChris Horvers -- J.', '\nAnd then in terms of the two-year trend in March relative to the overall quarter?', ""\nTiffany Mason -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSo two-year is -- it was the strongest on a one-year basis, and it's certainly the strongest on a two-year basis."", '\nChris Horvers -- J.', '\nChris Horvers -- J.', '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird.', '\nPeter Benedict -- Robert W.', '\nFirst question, we noticed the 62 PC&G stores that were reclassified over the Maintenance in the quarter.', '\nPeter Benedict -- Robert W.', ""\nBut just as we think about EBITDA going forward, I mean, is there any reason why the second quarter wouldn't be larger than the first quarter?"", ""\nSo again, we've rolled in the beat from Q1 into the outlook or into the guidance for the full year, and we've held Q2 through Q4 steady."", '\nPeter Benedict -- Robert W.', '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.', '\nTake 5 is a relatively new brand and new growth vehicle for us.', '\nThat business has phenomenal margins, mid-30% margins.', '\nSo the business is an amazing labor-efficient model.', '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.', '\nAnd we saw in 2020 this sort of inflection point, where I think the insurance carriers and our partners, we fixed hundreds of millions of dollars of cars of repairs on their behalf, they now absolutely see the benefit of doing business with fewer scale providers.', '\nKate McShane -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nSo we feel really good about the future for that business.', '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays.', ""\nYou're talking about the comp in April being in line with March, correct, not in line with the quarter?"", ""\nJonathan Fitzpatrick -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI don't think we actually gave, Karen, specific guidance for April comp."", '\nKaren Short -- Barclays -- Analyst\nOK.', ""\nWe've got extremely sort of high industry-leading NPS scores, Net Promoter Scores."", ""\nIn terms of our commercial customers, I think you've heard before that we have a very dedicated team that focuses on delivering great service to our insurance partners."", ""\nJonathan Fitzpatrick -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI think they're accelerating, I think, within the Take 5 business."", ""\nSo there would be some data points that I'd point you to."", '\nOperator\nOur last question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Sandler.', '\nCan you now, I guess, press the gas pedal on your advertising spend?', ""\nQuestion number two, in terms of the car wash unlock, look, it's a phenomenal business."", '\nGabe Mendoza and the team there are just doing wonderful things in terms of focusing on the key levers of that business.', '\nPeter Keith -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nOK.', ""\nBut we're just growing Wash Club -- non-Wash Club revenue per wash at a faster rate in this quarter."", '\nTiffany Mason -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSo we did add 50,000 Wash Club members, Peter, in the quarter, which is still phenomenal.', '\nOperator\nI will now turn the call back over to Mr.', '\nOperator\n[Operator signoff\nDuration: 52 minutes\nCall participants:\nJonathan Fitzpatrick -- President and Chief Executive

"'\nKevin L.', '\nIn addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.', ""\nAnd with that, I'll now turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and CEO."", '\nMoving to the financial and operational results for the third quarter on Slide five.', '\nDuring the third quarter, we delivered $767 million of adjusted EBITDA, which brings our year-to-date results to $1.', '\nDuring the quarter, we made good progress on our key strategic initiatives.', '\nNext, in ERCOT, the PUCT continues to advance necessary actions to improve market reliability.', '\nOn market design, the PUCT remains focused on a comprehensive solution to improve reliability and incentivize dispatchable resources.', '\nFinally, we are also announcing an 8% increase in our 2022 dividend, in line with our stated dividend growth rate of 7% to 9%.', '\nNext, our Texas region decreased by $68 million due to the higher supplier cost to serve our retail load.', '\nThe free cash flow before growth in the quarter was $395 million, a reduction of $230 million year-over-year, driven primarily by two factors, a $75 million increase in cash interest due to the $3 billion in Direct Energy financing in late 2020 and second is the movement in inventory.', '\nOn a year-to-date basis, our progress in terms of incremental profitability is significant and driven by the acquisition of Direct Energy.', '\nConsequently, we have also narrowed our free cash flow before growth guidance to $1.', '\nNext, we anticipate the sale of our East and West assets to close next month for a net of $620 million in sales proceeds, reducing EBITDA by $100 million going forward.', '\nLastly, with the change in the ERCOT market, we are expecting an increase in ancillary charges that were initiated after we contracted the customers and were not included in our margin price.', '\nGiven increased volatility in this environment, we are also increasing the range of our guidance with the expectation that we can identify enough mitigants in 2022 to offset the portion for these costs.', '\nI will now turn to Slide nine, where we are updating our plan 2021 capital allocation.', '\nMoving to the Winter Storm Uri, and as discussed before, the midpoint for the net estimated cash impact for Winter Storm Uri remains at $600 million.', '\nMoving to the next column, to pursue our targeted net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio, we completed the delivering of $250 million, plus early redemption fees of $64 million in Q3, totaling $319 million.', '\nFinally, on Slide 10, after reducing our corporate debt balance for 2021, debt delevering and for the minimum cash, our 2021 net debt balance will be approximately $7.', '\nAs discussed during Investor Day, given our growth profile, our goal is to achieve investment-grade metrics of 2.', '\nThe Direct Energy transaction significantly increased our scale and materially enhanced our natural gas capabilities.', '\nIn addition to natural gas and dual product customer growth, we will continue to invest in our core power business to extend our market-leading position in competitive retail electricity by continuing to meet the customers, where they are and to deliver the innovation that customers have come to expect from NRG and its family of brands.', '\nUpon closing Direct Energy, we immediately began rationalizing offices in areas with significant employee geographic overlap and completed a number of critical system consolidations without any meaningful impact to the operations of the company.', '\nAlthough this staging year will not be as a growth capital intensive as the later years, it is a crucial year in which we will need to develop data-backed conviction in our initiatives in order to have the confidence to deploy more significant capital in 2023 and 2024.', ""\nNow as we're turning our attention to 2022 with limited cost on our capital, I wanted to take a moment to review our capital allocation framework and capital available for allocation."", '\nI look forward to providing you a comprehensive capital allocation update on our next earnings call, but this should give you a good idea of our financial flexibility.', '\nAs we move into 2022, I am confident our platform is well-positioned to deliver strong and predictable results and create significant shareholder value.', '\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions Your first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.', '\nNow to your question around realized and unrealized.', '\nAnd then finally, as you mentioned, I mean, this is a very evolving story.', '\nAnd also, if I can throw out just the third question super quickly.', '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.', ""\nNow having said that, I expect 2022 to perhaps be a little bit lighter on the investing in growth as opposed to '23, '24 and '25."", '\nMauricio Gutierrez -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I mean, our plan would be to provide you a lot more clarity in the next earnings call.', '\nI have said in the past, I believe that buying back our shares at these discounts creates value for our shareholders.', ""\nMauricio Gutierrez -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, Michael, I will tell you, it's always free cash flow per share growth because that's what matters to our shareholders, the per-share metrics."", '\nSo I think this balanced approach serves us well in the long run.', '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim.', ""\nShar Pourreza -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst\nWe started to sort of beat on this a little bit, but I just want to get a bit of a stronger sense, I'm still getting questions here on it."", ""\nAnd sort of the significant coal supply chain cost, can they be mitigated if this isn't a short-term headwind?"", '\nMauricio Gutierrez -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThe ancillary service was ERCOT instituted a short term -- increasing ancillaries to maintain the reliability of the system.', ""\nNow we're still waiting to see, right, PUCT has -- had working sessions, and we've seen a memo from Chairman Lake detailing his thoughts."", ""\nAnd then also, we've been advocating for an LSE obligation that would phase in over a couple of years, and Chairman Lake included that in his memo too."", '\nMauricio Gutierrez -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nNow Shar, just to be clear, I mean, some of these ancillary costs that Chris is describing, a lot of them we passed them through already to our customers.', '\nShar Pourreza -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst\nAnd then just lastly, you added 500 megawatts of PPAs and ERCOT last quarter.', '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.', '\nSo that infrastructure gives us the ability to manage some of the volatility that exists, less on the price of NYNEX and more on the basis.', '\nAnd then on the power side, I think we -- I already described it, Steve, in terms of higher gas prices, you have this issue on the coal constraints.', ""\nSo that's how I'm thinking about it."", ""\nMauricio Gutierrez -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI mean, I think you need to recognize that '22 is a transition year, and our commitment is achieving this in 2023, which we expect to go back to our normalized earnings."", '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski from Seaport.', '\nAnd again, there is a need to support the stock.', '\nMauricio Gutierrez -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I mean, as I said, Angie, the first thing is, I think the value proposition of NRG has always been this balanced approach between a strong balance sheet, returning capital and growing.', ""\nSo what you're describing is basically levering up to buy back stock."", ""\nAnd again, I understand you don't separate, but I mean, again, to me, it just seems like there is a weakening of the profitability of that large retail book for various reasons, some of which you do not control."", ""\nSo I wouldn't characterize it as a retail thing."", ""\nSo I just want to be careful that I wouldn't -- I actually wouldn't characterize it as a retail concern."", ""\nSo there should be potential excess generation from the coal plants, which, OK, is not materializing because you don't have access to incremental coal supplies, but why would it be a drag versus the initial hedge?"", '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold from Vertical Research.', '\nJonathan Arnold -- Vertical Research Partners -- Analyst\nDo you have any business interruption or

"'\nOperator\nGood day, and welcome to the Carpenter Technology Corporation fourth-quarter fiscal-year\xa02019 financial results conference call.', '\nWhile the SAO segment performed below the 1.', '\nBefore we discuss the fourth-quarter results, I will take a few minutes to cover our impressive fiscal-year\xa02019 results.', '\nAs we delivered strong year-over-year earnings performance, consistent backlog growth and significantly strengthened our position as an irreplaceable supply chain partner for our customers.', '\nAnother area I am excited about is how we have advanced our customer relationship buy deepening existing ones, unlocking new markets for our applications and adding new customers after demonstrating the value of our solutions.', ""\nWe're also executing against this strategic long-term vision that includes maximizing our attractive core business through share gains, innovative solutions, increased productivity and additional capacity from our Athens facility."", '\nOur fourth-quarter results marked a solid finish to a successful year and reflect a continuation of several key trends.', '\nThe results reflects the impact of improving product mix, increased productivity via our Carpenter operating model and the benefits of the additional capacity at Athens.', ""\nIn fact, the fourth quarter marked Dynamet's best performance since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015."", '\nLooking first at aerospace and defense where we generate strong growth with sales up 17% compared to last year and 11% sequentially.', '\nThere is strong underlying demand, and Carpenter Technology has multiple products on virtually every platform.', '\nAs I noted, our medical backlog is up 27% year\xa0over\xa0year and the planned expansion at Dynamet will enable us to better capitalize on attractive growth opportunities we see in this end-use market.', '\nThese market headwinds negatively impacted our Amega West business and the adoption rate of certain new tools, which Tim will discuss in more detail later in the presentation.', '\nThe decline in both periods was driven lower light vehicle production levels due to the impact of global economic uncertainty and trade actions.', '\nThe recent fourth-quarter results reflect the continuous execution of our solutions focused commercial strategy, combined line with the strong demand environment in our key end-use markets and improvements in key operational processes.', '\nGoing forward, in fiscal 2020, we would expect SG&A expenses to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million per quarter as we increase our strategic efforts in growth areas like additive manufacturing.', '\nNet income for the quarter was $48.', '\nFor the fiscal year, free cash flow was negative $54 million, which includes $79 million for the acquisition of LPW in Q2 and $180 million of capital expenditures for the year.', '\nThis represents a sequential increase of $32 million or 8% on 2% higher shipment volume.', ""\nThe current quarter's performance marks the highest quarterly margin performance since the first quarter of 2014."", '\nWith that said, our expectations for the upcoming Q1 when implying an increase of 40% to 45% over Q1 of fiscal 2019, and would result in the best first quarter in recent history.', ""\nPEP's recent results were also negatively impacted by some inventory writedowns in our powder business."", ""\nOver the course of the last several months, we've applied for multitude of exemptions from tariffs on the products bought and in turn, sold by our distribution business."", '\nWe currently expect interest expense to be approximately $5 million favorable to fiscal year 2019 at $21 million, driven by an increase from capitalized interest on large capital projects.', '\nThe result was an optimized and simplified manufacturing process for an aerospace AM part, and offers the opportunity to expand part production across the multiple aerospace applications.', '\nNumber one, we continue to generate consistent year-over-year sales and earnings growth through solid execution of our commercial strategy and our ongoing focus on enhanced manufacturing disciplines via the Carpenter operating model.', '\nCarpenter Technology has not reduced production rate and has no current plans to reduce production rate as these are longer lead times products and our solutions are utilized across multiple aircraft applications and platforms.', ""\nWe're benefiting from the additional capacity provided by Athens and continue to achieve incremental VAP qualification."", '\nSpecifically, the SAO guidance, if achieved, would deliver one of the best quarters in the history of SAO and certainly, the best first quarter ever.', '\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions And the first question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company.', '\nGautam Khanna -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nTony Thene -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI mean, as you know Gautam, not every specific qualification is -- has the equal weight, right?', '\nIn fact, I would say that was some one of the most highest-content activity in this quarter to date.', '\nChris Olin -- Longbow Research -- Analyst\nTony, in the beginning of your presentation, I believe you attributed three\xa0things to the better operating performance at SAO.', '\nAnd then, I think, just from a mix and top-line perspective, you can see the growth in sales, especially in aerospace where some of high mix exist.', '\nThe commercial team is doing fantastic in this type of environment to cement long-term relationships.', ""\nSo listen, we bridge quarter\xa0over\xa0quarter, and I can tell you exactly where -- what each one of the values were of those, but I don't think it's conducive really for us to get in to a habit of doing that quarter\xa0over\xa0quarter."", '\nChris Olin -- Longbow Research -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nIt is going to be incremental every quarter as we move a next tranche of tons to Athens.', '\nChris Olin -- Longbow Research -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nI guess, my question is when Boeing tells its suppliers to shift down to 42 per month or get in line with the master schedule, is there a way to think about it in terms of how that impacts you over the three- to six-month period?', '\nTony Thene -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nChris, I would look at it this way.', '\nJosh Sullivan -- Seaport Global Securities, LLC -- Analyst\nHey, good morning.', ""\nTony Thene -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, for us, aerospace is

"""\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Taposh Bari, Head of Investor Relations."", '\nTaposh Bari -- Head of Investor Relations\nThank you for joining us to review our second quarter 2020 earnings results.', '\nBefore we begin, I would like to draw your attention to the disclaimer on Slide 2 of our presentation.', '\nWe will also discuss non-IFRS financial measures during the call today.', '\nAnd with that, I will hand the call over to Stefan.', ""\nEarlier today, we reported our second quarter earnings results, marking Nomad's 14th consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth."", '\nStarting first with our second quarter earnings results.', '\nAdjusted EBITDA growth of 21% to EUR119 million.', '\nBased on our year-to-date performance and our expectation that sales growth in the back half will now remain elevated, we are raising our organic revenue guidance for the year.', ""\nLet's turn to the details of the second quarter, beginning on Slide 4."", '\nAt Nomad, our business has performed at the very high level.', '\nWhile we had original plans for strong growth in 2020, the impact of COVID-19 has undeniably accelerated our top and bottom line results due in large part to an influx of new consumers discovering our brands and significant repeat behavior since the start of the pandemic.', '\nIn terms of repeat purchase, we saw a notable year-on-year uptick among users who will repurchase two times or more during the quarter.', '\nWe responded to sustained and innovative demand by running our product lines at maximum capacity, while creating new safety protocols in our factories, all which have remained open and operational throughout this pandemic.', '\nAs you may know, our largest factories in Bremerhaven, Reken and Lowestoft were already running at high utilization rates prior to COVID-19.', '\nMoving on to gross margins.', '\nAs you may know, we have successfully navigated an unprecedented level of raw material inflation in 2019 and 2020 arising from a correction in fish prices and persistent strength of the US dollar.', '\nAnother recent trend has been a strengthening of the euro, which is near two-year high versus the US dollar.', '\nFinally, we generated a significant amount of cash in Q2, bringing our first six-month adjusted free cash flow generation to EUR243 million.', '\nOur business has performed at an exceptional level through the first six months of 2020 with consumer shift toward home consumption, and frozen food, in particular, providing strong macro tailwinds.', ""\nWhile this year guidance would have been even higher with all these investments, we're fortunate to have the opportunity to deploy capital to create sustained long-term value for our shareholders."", '\nIn terms of distribution, Green Cuisine which was available in only two countries at the start of the year is now available in 10 European markets, and will be in all our markets by early 2021.', ""\nAnd finally, we're making excellent progress along our innovation agenda with Green Cuisine set to expand into the exciting meat-free poultry category in the coming weeks starting with the UK market."", ""\nI'd like to conclude by providing some broader perspective as we celebrate our fifth year anniversary as a public company."", '\nWhile we have clearly benefited from unprecedented demand for frozen food, this slide also demonstrates our longer term track record for growth leading up to this year.', '\nAs we sit here today, we see numerous avenues for growth within our European frozen food footprint, both organically and inorganically.', '\nThis brings me to our intention to repurchase up to $500 million of our stock through a modified Dutch auction process.', '\nOur confidence in the growth prospect of our business and the European frozen food category has never been higher.', '\nAnd with that, I will hand the call over to Samy to discuss the financials and guidance in more detail.', '\nSecond quarter gross margins expanded 50 basis points to 30.', '\nMoving down to the rest of the P&L.', '\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 21% to EUR119 million and adjusted EPS increased 26% to EUR0.', '\nTurning to cash flow on Slide 8, we generated EUR243 million of adjusted free cash flow during the first six months of the year, nearly three times the amount that we have generated for the same period a year ago.', '\nWe converted nearly 180% of our adjusted EBITDA into adjusted free cash flow through the first six months of the year, reflecting seasonality, structural enhancement and the effects from COVID-19.', ""\nWith that, let's turn to Slide 9 to review our 2020 guidance, which is based on foreign exchange rates as of August 3, 2020."", '\nOur guidance now assume an elevated level of organic revenue growth in the second half of the year, reflecting four factors.', '\nAs I mentioned earlier, gross margins are expected to increase in the back half of the year as a result of supply chain productivity.', '\nAndrew Lazar -- Barclays Capital -- Analyst\nI wanted to start off, if I could.', ""\nAnd in terms of M&A, yes, I think, it's important to mention and you're right, talking about

motivation of our people.', ""\nSamy, anything else I'm missing?"", '\nWhat we also can see is, yes, initially we thought that we will be a bit late this year, given COVID, because when you have that kind of crisis, the retailers -- and for the right reasons, by the way, the retailers prefer to focus on a very limited number of SKUs because it make their life easier.', ""\nAnd in our model, John,

the Securities and Exchange Commission for more information concerning non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.', '\nThe Baltic Supramax Index averaged $16,633 in the first quarter, up almost $6,000 or 55% as compared to Q4, representing one of the best historic quarterly increases on both a dollar and percentage basis.', ""\nI think it's important to highlight the values are moving higher on the back of a significant increase in the volumes of sale on purchase transactions as well."", '\nSpot rates around 10-year highs, prices remain well discounted to 2010 levels when spot rates were similar.', '\nEagle generated a net TCE for the first quarter of $15,124 for the highest level in more than 10 years.', '\nIn terms of operating

Q1, $364 higher than the prior quarter, and an increase in the number of drydocks completed in the quarter.', '\nCash interest expense came in at $1,573 per ship per day in Q1, which is marginally higher on a decrease in ownership days in the quarter.', '\nThe strength in the Atlantic market was broad-based, but in particular, robust grain shipments to China, pet coke from the U.', '\nFirstly, I think it underscores how strong trade volumes within the sub-region are, with Chinese steam coal imports being a significant contributor.', '\nFuel prices continue to trend higher on the back of increased demand for oil products.', '\nA total of 47 dry bulk ships were ordered during Q1, down by roughly 28% as compared to the quarterly average for last year.', '\nThe IMF is now estimating the global GDP contracted by 3.', ""\nWith that, I'd like to now turn the call back over to the operator and answer any questions that you may have."", '\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator

S&P markets done since, I think, you spent just under $100 million on those vessels, and they're probably worth closer to $140 million."", '\nAs I said in our -- in the prepared remarks, we think that asset values are trailing based on the current market.', ""\nBut really in our mind, it's about obtaining fair value based on where we think, the cash flow generation is for those ships in the forward curve."", ""\nGary Vogel -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes, I would actually caution that because it's a very dynamic model, and it includes derivatives that we use to hedge away market risk and keep optional periods."", '\nBut again, it also depends on, as I said, what the risk profile is of that.', ""\nI think you will see some growth, but it's not growth for growth's sake, just for the benefit

"'\nOperator\nWelcome to the Q2 2022 ConocoPhillips earnings conference call.', '\nMark Keener -- Vice President, Investor Relations\nThank you, Richard, and welcome to everyone joining us for our second quarter earnings call.', '\nBefore I turn it over to them, just a few quick reminders.', ""\nAnd finally, we'll make reference to some non-GAAP financial measures today."", ""\nNow before I get into the results for the quarter, I'd also like to touch on a few things that continue to be top of mind for us."", ""\nBy fulfilling our triple mandate of responsibly and reliably meeting energy transition pathway demand, delivering competitive returns on and of capital and progressing toward achieving our net zero operational emissions ambition, we're playing a key role in providing secure, dependable energy solutions that are clearly needed around the globe."", ""\nThe potential investment is designed to leverage our company's considerable strength as one of the largest gas producers and marketers in North America, while expanding our global LNG business."", '\nApplying the rigorous OGMP 2.', ""\nOnce again, we've increased our targeted 2022 distributions to shareholders, taking the total full year expected returns to $15 billion."", '\nNow let me turn it over to Bill to cover our overall performance for the quarter.', '\nThese actions taken in combination with the $600 million in disposition proceeds and the repurchase of approximately $300 million in long-term investments, resulted in cash back of $8.', '\nNow in conjunction with these changes, we reduced DD&A guidance from $7.', '\nOperating capital guidance for the year remains unchanged at $7.', '\nWe continue to strengthen our fortress balance sheet, and we have reduced total debt by $3 billion year to date.', ""\nAnd the questions we got from investors this morning, given there's a variable element to it, is should we think of this as being oil price dependent in any way?"", ""\nNow we do recognize that certainly post-Ukrainian invasion, and we've had long held this view that gas is going to be more of a transition fuel as we transition to lower-carbon alternatives going forward, and we wanted to play."", '\nStephen Richardson -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGreat.', '\nThe first question, I guess, is just following up on those comments, Ryan, on Sempra.', ""\nStephen Richardson -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nThat's really helpful."", ""\nThat's the one project, obviously, we think about when you hear about NEPA, but maybe you could address that, please."", '\nIt takes a long time, the coordination through all the various government agencies that have responsibility within the NEPA process, and it just takes a lot of time.', '\nSo it gives us a little bit of question as to whether or not it will get done, but it is in desperate need of some NEPA reform.', ""\nWe're interested in rebuilding a little bit of cash after the last transaction earlier this year that we spent some cash on, which has been a very good transaction for the company."", ""\nWe still want to build some cash on the balance sheet for the volatility we see in the market and the terms that we see going forward, but we're pretty constructive over the next few years on the commodity price."", '\nCan you maybe discuss how your costs are trending versus your expectations?', '\nSo if you take that that gives us an estimated incremental capex of approximately $900 million for the NFE project.', ""\nYou're a big gas trader in the U."", ""\nIt's also interesting to us in terms of ensuring strong flow assurance for our own production."", ""\nRyan Lance -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nAnd the other part, Roger, I would say -- Jack could chime in too here, but just the gas resource that we have as a result of the transactions over the last couple of years, we've got a very large, high-quality gas resource that we could -- we hope to be pivoting to over time to even supply a lot of this gas."", ""\nRyan Lance -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I think, generally speaking, the Sharmila Mulligan Bill is -- I'm not sure if it's a good time ever to the increasing taxes and increasing government spending, just as a general economic policy, and that's a large part of what this bill goes to."", ""\nWe'll have to see how it develops over time and comes out with the extra regulation coming out of EPA."", '\nAnd you saw our OGMP 2.', '\nLast quarter, you talked about the U.', '\nAnd of course, the amounts and timing through 2022 can vary depending on price and other market conditions.', ""\nSo at a high level, we're in a cash tax paying position."", ""\nDoug Leggate -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nSo basically, if there is an E&P, there's no impact from you guys, it sounds like?"", '\nAnd then, of course, the overall capital budget, an issue that going back to when Matt was around, we used to get a lot was the idea of what the sustaining capital breakeven was for the portfolio.', ""\nBut the way we think about sustaining capital is you're probably going to be focused on that in a lower macro world, if you like, and inflation not quite so high."", '\nJohn Royall -- J.', ""\nAs for expectations for activity, good news is we're -- we plan to run steady in the back half of the year, and we are currently running the number of rigs that we plan to run for the rest of the year."", '\nJohn Royall -- J.', '\nBrent increased about 12%.', '\nAnd then on the crude side, in particular, we had better realizations coming out of Alaska for the quarter.', '\nTwo quick questions, if I could.', '\nNow related to FID, we would probably see that at the earliest later this year and most likely early next.', '\nSo the key thing is really looking forward to that final SEIS and a supportive record of decision.', '\nNeal Dingmann -- Truist Securities -- Analyst\nMy first question just on value creation.', ""\nSo I'd say what we're trying to do is reduce our capital intensity."", ""\nWe think that's a better value proposition to the shareholders rather than just focusing on either growth or return to capital."", ""\nSo we have to live with the capital or the cash that's left over."", '\nAnd then out of that comes a production number and a sequencing of the projects to allow the further growth in the development of the company over the long haul.', '\nLeo Mariani -- MKM Partners -- Analyst\nHey, guys.', '\nLeo Mariani -- MKM Partners -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nFor instance, can you maybe clarify whether the gas to be sold will be oil-linked or will it be linked to a gas price hub?', ""\nRyan Lance -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nLet me start, and I'll kick it to Bill a little bit."", '\nI think the focus of the

"'\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Donnelley Financial Solutions first-quarter earnings conference call.', '\nFor a complete discussion, please refer to the cautionary statements included in our earnings release and further detailed in our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly report on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.', '\nPlease refer to the earnings release and related tables for GAAP financial information and reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial information.', '\nThis performance, coupled with prudent financial discipline, resulted in net leverage of 2.', '\nWe implemented work from home for all those that could in mid-March; shut down all travel and conference hosting in attendance; and took great care to protect our manufacturing employees, a group that is unable to work from home, conducting temperature monitoring, distancing within and between shifts and implementing disinfecting protocols, at least as robust as the guidelines from the CDC and the World Health Organization.', '\nOur plan is to deliver 44% of our revenue from software solutions by the year 2024.', '\nGiven this mix shift, our expectation is that by the year-end 2022, the consolidated business should be posting positive organic revenue growth.', '\nRegarding the 30E3 regulation that takes effect in the first quarter of 2021, we continue to refine our plan and preparation.', ""\nBut I did want to specifically call your attention to the supporting schedules in today's press release, which provide additional segment information for each quarter of 2019."", '\nOn a consolidated basis, net sales for the first quarter of 2020 were $220.', '\nThis mix shift helps drive margin expansion which we expect to continue going forward as our revenue becomes more heavily weighted toward software solutions and tech-enabled services.', '\nThe increase in non-GAAP SG&A expense is due primarily to higher employee benefits cost.', '\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin for the segment was 16.', '\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin for the segment was 26.', '\nThe tremendous increase in non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin was due primarily to cost efficiencies related to our Arc regulatory solutions in Europe where we gained significant efficiencies by moving from an outsourced to an in-house solution.', '\nOur first-quarter 2020 non-GAAP unallocated corporate expenses were $10 million, an increase of $2.', ""\nThis trend continued in this year's first quarter when we did reduce the cash usage by nearly 50% compared to the first quarter of 2019."", '\nLastly, we repurchased approximately 616,000 shares of our common stock during the first quarter at an average price per share of $6.', '\nArc reporting continued its growth in Europe, winning a multiyear contract to provide financial reporting software to RBC and Luxembourg.', '\nAs regulatory requirements continue to shift globally, the need to consolidate reporting solutions has never been more critical.', '\nOur analysis includes the mutual fund and variable annuity shareholder reports, print and distribution work that will be reduced in January 2021, in addition to specific customer contracts and business lines that in absence of the work related to 30e-3 would no longer generate enough profit to justify maintaining our network of third party and internal print and distribution capacity necessary to produce that work.', '\nOur team has been working diligently to refine our planning, and we now estimate that the total annual reduction in revenue will be in the range of $130 million to $140 million, and the annual reduction to EBITDA will be in the range of $10 million to $50 million starting in January 2021.', '\nFurther, we continue to expect low- to mid-teens growth in our software solutions revenue and recognize that, while we describe the 30e-3 regulatory driven reduction in print and its impacts in isolation, even absent 30e-3 each year, we face a decline in print for which we need to overcome by growth elsewhere in the portfolio, as well as cost management.', '\nAs we have an opportunity to continue to serve our clients in the manner in which they desire to be served, scale our existing offerings and high incremental margins while also introducing new offerings into our existing client relationships, as we did with Arc regulatory this quarter.', '\nFrom a culture perspective, we continue to merge the talent that we have post spinoff with new leaders from the technology industry who have infused the culture with new ideas, helping to modernize our business, at the same time, retaining the industry expertise that makes DFIN a trusted partner.', '\nWith an opportunity to further increase this earnings-per-share growth through future share repurchases.', ""\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Dave to discuss our perspective on the balance of the year."", '\nOver 60% of our business is recurring in nature.', '\nTo add some context of size, revenue for our transaction-related revenue, including Venue, in the last three quarters of 2019 was approximately $255 million, nearly 40% of our total revenue for the last three quarters of 2019.', '\nRegarding capital expenditures, which we previously expected to be approximately $35 million, we now expect to be in a range of $30 million to $35 million in light of the current situation in our end markets.', '\nRegarding profitability, we expect our second-quarter non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 16% to 17%, down approximately 500 basis points from the second quarter of 2019 due to the expected lower level of transactional activity, partially offset by the impact of our ongoing cost-savings initiatives.',

on the 30e-3.', ""\nAs we've said previously from print and distribution, we have our own assets, and then we also rely on the trade."", ""\nAnd then, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, from a strategic perspective, we're excited."", '\nCharlie Strauzer -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nGreat.', '\nSo transactions that more market-sensitive IPOs, M&A spin were reduced and product lines, such as debt issuances, were markedly higher.', '\nAnd we would expect this favorable low interest rate environment and access to financing, as well as some of the underlying dynamics of digital transformation technological disruption etc.', '\nRoughly 60% of our activities in the first half of the year driven largely by client compliance schedules.', '\nSo David, you want to jump in more

business model and scale by geography, channel, product, or service is poised to generate strong growth, particularly asset growth through cycles and with a consistent risk appetite.', '\nWe are seeing green shoots of growth in our higher-yielding Canadian credit card and commercial loan portfolios, both up quarter over quarter.', '\nOver the last year, we added $43 billion of personal and business deposits in Canadian banking and a further USD 14 billion in deposits at City National.', '\nRBC Global Asset Management had $35 billion in total net sales over the last 12 months, increasing assets under management 13% or over $67 billion year over year to record levels.', ""\nWe're also adding ultra-high net worth private banking teams in City National on the East Coast, along with an expanded presence in our core California markets."", '\nSeveral of these capabilities are made in RBC proprietary solutions.', '\nWe have expanded our slate of partners who continue to be a differentiator for RBC, and with the recent addition of DoorDash and FinanceIt, it will help attract new clients and create more value for existing clients.', '\nThe recent launch of RBC Vantage further incentivizes the consolidation of our strong client relationships.', '\nThe related fee-based revenue, along with higher client savings and card payments, rates have been positive for credit quality and risk-adjusted revenue metrics, helping offset margin pressure.', ""\nThese results yet again highlight the resilience of RBC's diversified business model."", '\nAnd strong internal capital generation net of dividends added nearly 50 basis points of capital.', '\nWe expect the net impact of the reforms to be moderately favorable as the benefit from the implementation of the guidelines in 2023 are partly offset by adverse market risk impacts under the fundamental review of the trading book coming into effect in 2024.', '\nCanadian banking NIM decreased 4 basis points from last quarter, largely due to competitive pricing pressures in mortgages and changes in asset mix.', '\nHigher service charges and card service revenue reflected the benefits of higher client activity in Canadian banking.', '\nNon-compensation costs declined largely due to lower facility and cleaning costs.', '\nMoving to our business segment performance, beginning on Slide 14.', '\nNoninterest revenue was up largely due to higher mutual fund distribution fees underpinned by very strong AUA growth.', '\nWealth management reported record quarterly earnings of $738 million, up 31% from last year.', '\nIn addition, strong volumes drove 9% year-over-year growth in City National net interest income in U.', '\nInvestor & Treasury Services reported net income of $88 million, up 16% from an even more challenged quarter last year.', '\nCorporate Investment Banking reported record investment banking revenue.', '\nFICC trading results were down 35% year over year as tightening credit spreads last year drove mark-to-market gains, as well as robust activity in our spread business.', '\nEquity issuance, activity is also expected to remain solid but lower than peaks experienced in the first half of the fiscal year.', '\nThe release reflects improvements in both our macroeconomic outlook, as well as the credit quality of our portfolio during the quarter.', '\nOur gross impaired loans of $2.',

revolver side?', '\nSo there has been a segment that used to pay us interest that no longer pays us interest.', '\nAnd he talked about categories, I think, last quarter that everything was up, except for travel and dining.', '\nIn terms of buy now, pay later, what I would say is there are options that clients have, and it was a good article in the globe about how this may play out differently in Canada than other markets.', ""\nIs there any reason you think that a 20% ROE wouldn't be sustainable going forward?"", '\nDave McKay -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks for that question.', ""\nSo some of the positives, as we've talked about on the call already are higher-yielding asset growth, such as credit card revolve rates coming back, credit card spend with all the revenue drivers, the NIM stabilization, the NIM expansion being really positive for ROE, particularly in Canadian banking, but also City National."", '\nOur very strong fee-based revenue generation

color."", '\ntangible book value of 17%, part of that is showing that our organic client-driven growth is going to be ROE accretive.', '\nSo you strip that out, and you should see ROE in the high

loan losses.', '\nMario Mendonca -- TD Securities -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nThanks for taking my question.', '\nI think one of the

translate through."", ""\nSo with that, I'll turn it back to Dave."", ""\nWe talked about moving into the mid-corporate area and growth in our high net worth core banking are all key abilities for us

important, some of the swings that Steve just talked about, and I think he's bounded those properly for you."", '\nGabe Hajde -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\nI appreciate that.', ""\nSo I guess

into the 10 weeks of backlog and the growth that we're seeing here, overindexed really to CRB in '22 and heading into '23."", '\nOperator\nWe have a question from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs.', ""\nAnd you alluded to industry operating rates in North America, we'll get the official data for the second quarter later this week."", ""\nMike Doss -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nIt's a great question, Adam."", '\nJust to put that in perspective a little bit for you, what that means, that $9 an MMBtu at our most efficient CRB mill in Kalamazoo, Michigan, that would equate to roughly $50 a ton.', ""\nSo when you think about cost structures and trade flows and like FBB and virgin paperboard and where it goes and what people would have to do over the short and medium term, that's a challenge for the CRB manufacturers in Europe sure."", ""\nWe're obviously paying higher prices."", ""\nSteve Scherger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes, Adam, it's a great question."", '\nAdam Samuelson -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Mike Roxland from Truist.', ""\nMike Doss -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nLike I said at the Investor Day, Michael, we're going to run trials."", ""\nAnd we like kind of the optionality that we've got with our existing mill footprint that we have, and as Steve alluded to, we've got a lot of levers that we can pull here depending on how things develop over the next year or two."", '\nOperator\nThe last question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets.', '\nArun Viswanathan -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGreat.', '\nDo you expect capex to remain kind of in the $450 million to $500 million range?', ""\nI expect it to be solid given what we're seeing, and we're a large component of that, as you well know."", ""\nSteve Scherger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nAnd Arun, on capex, as we've talked capex in the 5% of sales, so $450 million to $500 million is clearly good baseline capex that allows us to maintain our assets appropriately as well as invest for kind of core productivity, any projects that would be beyond that we would call out very specifically with identifiable returns as part of our overall approach to capital allocation."", '\nArun Viswanathan -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThanks.', ""\nOperator\nI'll

"""\nOperator\nGood morning, and welcome to S&P Global's fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings conference call."", ""\nChip Merritt -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations\nThank you for joining today's S&P Global fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call."", '\nBefore we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements.', '\nInvestors and security holders of S&P Global or IHS Markit stock are urged to carefully read the entire registration statement and joint proxy statement and prospectus, which are available on our website and sec.', '\nAny investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of S&P Global should give me a call to better understand the impact of this legislation on the investor and potentially the company.', '\nUpon closing of the merger, we are well-prepared to rapidly begin operating as one company and to begin to realize both the cost and revenue synergies we have already outlined to you.', '\nTo recap the financial results for the full year, organic revenue increased 12% to $8.', ""\nIt's important to note that adjusted EPS of $13."", '\nThe largest revenue gain was the 16% in Indices.', '\nAnd this has resulted in a nearly doubling of our adjusted diluted EPS over that time frame.', '\nIn 2021, we launched Sustainable1 to elevate and coordinate external ESG efforts across the company.', '\nWe ended 2021 with ESG ETF AUM reaching $32.', '\nWe also enhanced ESG offerings available on Capital IQ Pro, expanded S&P Global ESG scores coverage to 11,500 companies and expanded coverage of climate risk analytics to more than 3 million physical assets such as mines, power stations and buildings.', '\nClimate changes created the need to evaluate the impact of different climate-related scenarios on counterparties, investments and portfolios.', '\nCodex is available on Capital IQ Pro.', '\nAnd on average, daily price assessments are completed 70 minutes faster.', ""\nAnd we've begun monetizing Kensho Link, Kensho Scribe, RPA, data extraction and machine learning development."", '\nThis increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 6%.', '\nInflation has proven to be more persistent than thought and now presents a key policy challenge in the U.', ""\nBefore I finish, I want to say that I'm incredibly proud of the team we've built at S&P Global, and I look forward to welcoming the talented IHS Markit employees to S&P Global."", ""\nAdjusted total expenses increased 9%, and I'll come back to this on the next slide."", '\nFor the fourth quarter, they increased 9%.', '\nThis quarter, all four segments delivered increased revenue with Indices leading the way with an 18% increase.', '\nIn 2021, headcount decreased 1% primarily for two reasons.', '\nCognitive automation and RPA generated over 600,000 hours of savings in 2021.', '\nThis year, with the formation of Sustainable1, we added this as a new category.', '\nLast year, we shared this slide and estimated that we would invest $100 million on growth initiatives in 2021.', '\nOn our third quarter 2020 earnings call, we introduced a new $120 million productivity program to be completed over a two- to three-year period.', '\nFree cash flow, excluding certain items, was $3.', '\nStarting with S&P Dow Jones Indices, the segment delivered 18% revenue growth primarily due to gains in AUM linked to our indices and increased exchange-rated derivative activity.', '\nS&P Dow Jones Indices delivered growth across all revenue channels this quarter.', '\nActivity at the CBOE increased in the fourth quarter with S&P 500 Index options activity increasing 47% and fixed futures and options activity increasing 18%.', '\nThis resulted in an 18% increase in adjusted segment operating profit and a 300 basis point increase in adjusted segment operating profit margin.', '\nTransaction revenue increased primarily due to strength in investment-grade corporate bonds, bank loans and structured products.', '\nOn the right side of this slide, you can see the changes in revenue within Structured Products.', '\nApproximately 14% of this growth was from new products.', '\nAdjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 160 basis points to 50.', '\nUsage of our key market platforms increased 4% year over year, while year-ending active users increased 13% to 299,000 users.', '\nIn addition, the platform offers greater visibility into private companies and private markets, as well as regulatory, supply chain, climate data and analytics and ESG scores.', '\nAnd then the second would be from the EC.', ""\nOne thing that they've looked at is what was the growth in issuance over the last couple of years in all the different sectors?"", '\nBut just how should we think about the ramp of ESG in the different segments?', ""\nYour question with respect to each of the segments, you're right that Platts is still the highest, the largest in terms of ESG revenue contribution."", ""\nMaybe talk about how the volatility impacts the Indices business, the Market Intelligence and then Platts as well because I think there's puts and takes across the model, but maybe the increased volatility, again, how that impacts Indices, Intelligence and then maybe just a spike in oil within the context of Platts, if you could."", '\nSo clearly, volatility is helping the company both from a value add, but then also about directly to revenue streams in both the Index and the Platts business.', '\nAlex Kramm -- UBS -- Analyst\nHey, good morning, everyone.', '\nAs you know, M&A is one of the biggest drivers of loan issuance.', ""\nThere's a lot of demand for floating rate paper."", '\nAlex Kramm -- UBS -- Analyst\nAll right.', ""\nCurious, I know you're not giving any guidance at this point, but how you think, on the one hand, that could impact your cost pressure that we've seen with other companies?"", ""\nSo as we built our plan and we're looking forward, we've been looking at this in the U."", ""\nThey're talking about it in the EC."", ""\nWhen it comes to labor markets, that's one of the areas I'm watching myself quite closely, both from a systemic point of view and then for our company itself."", '\nAlex Kramm -- UBS -- Analyst\nVery helpful.', '\nAshish Sabadra -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThanks for taking my question.', '\nSo I was just wondering if you could just provide us some puts and takes since the original guidance was given and whether the buyback was included in that original guidance?', ""\nAshish Sabadra -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThat's very helpful color."", ""\nBut overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we are making to get ready to start to realize those synergies and the concrete plans that we have put behind that."", ""\nAshish Sabadra -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThat's great."", '\nWe have such a complete toolkit of AI for unstructured data, which is about linking data, extraction, speech to text, the Codex platform that is now on Cap IQ Pro and has already 300,000 users to date.', '\nJust wondering like is the revenue material yet?', '\nBut our revenue is still light.', '\nAnd that is more or less, that mid-single-digit steady growth is to be expected going forward.', '\nAnd I know your revenue differs, obviously, with that figure because of pricing and non-transactional business and mix, etc.', ""\nThere is an interest, I've mentioned this before in other calls of -- in the European policy sector to stop having all of the dependence for corporate financing coming from banks and moving more to capital markets."", '\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.', '\nEwout Steenbergen -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes, good morning, Craig, and thanks for asking that question.', ""\nSo what you're seeing here from an expense growth perspective that the majority of the growth was coming from variable expenses, performance-related expenses, which I consider good expenses because they're directly correlated with healthy sales and revenue activity."", '\nAnd also the performance factors of our long-term incentive compensation are running a bit higher than in 2020.', '\nAnd it means that some of the new growth initiatives are still incremental to what we already have in place.', '\nCraig Huber -- Huber Research Partners -- Analyst\nAnd my follow-up, I guess, you guys touched on a little bit earlier about -- upon bank loans, the outlook for that.', '\nIn particular, the M&A market, we see is strong.', '\nBut spreads are tight, and interest rates are still very low on a historical basis.', '\nWe have invested in new initiatives like LNG, energy transition and agriculture, and they also start to pay off at this moment.', '\nWhat we see is that the ESG market itself for data and analytics as scores, it started to evolve as more and more insurance companies, institutional investors, asset managers take those factors into account as they make decisions.', ""\nAnd so there's different language out there, whether it's an impact fund, it's an ESG fund, it's an ESG approach."", ""\nWe do think that there is a really good effort going on across the private sector, as well as NGOs, along with these regulatory agencies to start addressing what would be the potential regulatory requests, as well as the market themselves coming to standards of how we're going to be disclosing this."", ""\nAnd we think that that's going to be a key differentiating factor for us as we build up our ESG business."", '\nWould you be opportunistic to do one large ASR or you would do multiple ASR for the rest of this year?', ""\nWe're also, of course, looking at the overall refinancing that we can do of the IHS Markit debt and potentially some opportunity for upsizing."", '\nJeff Silber -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThanks.', '\nBut our philosophy is to pay market rates to ensure that this is a great place to work, and Ewout can talk a little bit more of how that translates.', '\nBut overall, as I said to an earlier question, we believe that the impact is manageable because we have opportunities also to look at productivity, synergy, efficiencies, automation, as well as the opportunity to look at some contractual terms and fees over time.', '\nJeff Silber -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nJeff Meuler -- Robert W.', '\nAnd then a related technical question.', '\nJeff Meuler -- Robert W.', ""\nWe're going into our third year."", ""\nWe can provide an update on the company's strategy, the business segments, the synergies, the investment program, share repurchases, things that you asked about today or wanted to ask about today, and that would include guidance."", '\nSo again, I want to thank everyone for joining the call today.', '\nDuration: 73 minutes\nCall participants:\nChip Merritt -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations\nDoug Peterson -- President

"""\nOn today's call, we have Phil Baker, Hecla's president and CEO; Lauren Roberts, Hecla's senior vice president and chief operating officer; and Russell Lawlar, Hecla's senior vice president and chief financial officer."", ""\nWith that, I'll pass the call to Phil Baker."", '\nAs a result, the balance sheet is solid with $190 million in cash.', ""\nNow I'm highlighting these facts, not only to give credit to the good work that the guys at Casa -- guys and gals at Casa are doing, but also just to highlight the culture we have of improvement in innovation."", ""\nLastly, before I turn it over to Russell and Lauren, I'd like to discuss the inflationary pressure that has impacted the industry."", '\nAnd at Greens Creek with our fly in, fly out and almost fully vaccinated workforce of being able really to work from just about anywhere, we had higher-than-normal turnover in some certain job classifications in the last quarter.', '\nThus, while we were able to produce the tonnage, the number of ounces were lower as a result.', '\nSo during the quarter, our revenue continued to be driven by Greens Creek and Casa Berardi.', '\nOur leverage profile has remained similar to that of last quarter at 1.', '\nThe mining sequence was adjusted this to make best use case of the available working shifts, and this had us focus on zones near to the portal, but with lower silver grade.', '\nTo reflect the lower third quarter production, we are lowering silver production guidance to 9.', '\nThe Lucky Friday mine produced almost 832,000 ounces of silver and generated positive free cash flow of $7.', ""\nOn Slide 11, the Casa Berardi mine achieved record quarterly throughput of approximately 400,000 tons milled this quarter, the highest in the mine's history."", '\nWe are increasing our production guidance to 130,000 to 135,000 ounces of gold for the year.', '\nWe have remain focused on reducing and optimizing costs at the mine following the impressive results from our mill improvement program.', '\nand it makes Hecla the U.', '\nSo we had the impact of the change in the currency.', '\nAnd the way that we have approached this ESG is to make a real difference in our environment, for our employees and the communities that we operate in and for our shareholders, and first, for the environment.', '\nFor the U.', '\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions And your first question comes from the line of Heiko Ihle from H.', '\nHeiko Ihle -- H.', '\nHeiko Ihle -- H.', '\nYou spent almost $14 million on exploration in the quarter.', '\nAnd there you were stating that you were planning on replacing your reserves by the end of the year.', ""\nPhil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, Heiko, as you realize, we're still in the budgeting process for the coming year so I don't have -- I'm not going to be able to give you quarterly information."", '\nHaving said that, we are judicious on the use of this capital.', '\nHeiko Ihle -- H.', ""\nThat's a good answer and more or less what I was looking for."", '\nHeiko Ihle -- H.', '\nYou have essentially the equivalent of a quarter sales in cash on the balance sheet.', '\nPhil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nLook, Heiko, if you look at us historically, we had viewed the need to have the balance sheet be relatively conservative.', '\nHeiko Ihle -- H.', '\nLucas Pipes -- B.', ""\nBut I think it's going to be an ongoing challenge that we and everyone has."", ""\nAnd so I don't think we'll have any long-term issues."", ""\nLauren Roberts -- Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer\nSo I'll just reiterate that we're all enjoying the mining sector as we're all enjoying elevated metal prices and skilled trades, skilled miners are in high demand and we should expect some turnover as a result."", '\nLucas Pipes -- B.', ""\nAnd to follow up on this, it's the competition coming from within the mining sector or is it that the broader economy, where electricians can find a lot of work in other institute?"", '\nLucas Pipes -- B.', '\nAnd when it comes to retaining skilled labor, I assume labor rates will go up.', ""\nPhil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI think there's some increase that you'll see but it is, frankly, when you think about the fact that we spend an aggregate about half a billion dollars and a little more than that, it's really quite small, the impact that that will have on our cash flow."", ""\nLauren Roberts -- Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer\nI don't think we should anticipate across the board increases."", ""\nPhil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThe other thing is I think we just have a compensation structure that's quite competitive and there's a fair amount of pay that people get that is based on performance and the mine has had very good performance Greens Creek in particular but we see that happening with CASA with the improvements that we've made, at the Lucky Friday with the new mining method."", '\nLucas Pipes -- B.', ""\nPhil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI guess the first thing I'd say is that we have framed contracts for our concentrates so we don't have a concern for not having a home for the concentrates, which could be a concern."", ""\nRussell Lawlar -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nJust to confirm kind of what Phil has already said, we have long-term customers that we've been dealing with for many many years."", '\nLucas Pipes -- B.', '\nPhil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, we were at the virtual Isaac conference and talking to our customers and some of whom have these operations that were shut down and that was the question we were asking them.', '\nLucas Pipes -- B.', ""\nLauren Roberts -- Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer\nI'll just reiterate that being able to utilize the headings more than 80% of the time is a clear and obvious benefit in addition to the safety."", '\nPhil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nAnd you look at the Lucky Friday and with the reserve and the resource that it has and the exploration potential that it has both down-dip and on strike, you -- and within sort of a two or three-year -- two or three mile range around this infrastructure, the potential this has -- being able to manage the seismicity has a huge, huge value benefit for the mining company.', '\nLucas Pipes -- B.', ""\nPhil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, look, sort of the way this became apparent to us was as we were trying to advance the RVM and try to make the -- reduce the seismicity associated with this, we came to the conclusion that we could test this and potentially have this UCB method be an alternative or an or in addition to, and we've decided that it's an alternative to the RVM."", '\nLauren Roberts -- Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer\nI think the only thing I would follow up with though in answer to Lucas question about benchmarking, I think really the only thing you can benchmark the new method against is the previous method at the Lucky Friday because the Lucky Friday really is a unique setting from a geotechnical perspective.', ""\nPhil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nAnd you can expect, Lucas, over the course of the next sort of six months we'll provide quite a bit of detail and insight into how the method works and what the cycle is and how it changes the design of the mine because all of those things have come into play and all of them are in process, where we have been in a full on test of this for over a year now or, I guess, like at a year."", '\nLucas Pipes -- B.', '\nPhil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nOK.', '\nMichael Siperco -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThanks very much, guys.', '\nThe schedule had been in the process of being changed during the course of the quarter and

or August?', '\nMichael Siperco -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nMichael Siperco -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nRight.', ""\nAnd then maybe following up on the last question -- or part of last question, and you've touched on it a bit on the call, but I didn't see the word inflation in your results."", '\nPhil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSo the short answer, Michael, is that 50% of our costs are labor, about 10% energy, and nothing else is double digit.', ""\nLauren Roberts -- Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer\nSo I think for us it's -- our energy is essentially a fixed cost because of the hydro power."", '\nPhil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nAnd you think about contractors, cost of contractors has absolutely increased.', '\nMichael Siperco -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nAnd that actually, that last point was going to be my follow up.', '\nPhil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSo the good news is with the -- given that the two programs are relatively the -- will be the same, most of those rigs that we had in this year, we will have next year.', '\nMichael Siperco -- RBC Capital

"'\nScott McFeely, our senior vice president of Global Product and Services is also with us for Q&A.', ""\nA detailed reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to our GAAP results is included in today's press release."", '\nBuilding off an historic first quarter order flows.', '\nWe are clearly seeing a number of positive demand trends at a secular level that we believe are very durable over the long-term.', '\nTo put it simply, demand continues to significantly exceed supply and availability of supply is the most impactful factor in our performance and rate of revenue growth at this time.', '\nThis included direct web-scale revenue of 22%, an increase of 7% year over year, primarily for our Waveserver platform.', '\nQ2 was a record quarter for shipments of WaveLogic 5E, up 50% year over year and more than double that of last quarter.', '\nLooking at the overall demand environment, the shifts in business and consumer behavior have accelerated positive trends for our business, including cloud adoption, a greater focus on the network edge, which is really greater capacity closer to the customer, and the need of course for increased automation.', '\nIn routing and switching, we continue to secure new design wins around the world, primarily associated with growth in wireless and accelerated cloud adoption, again at the edge of the network.', '\nThese demand dynamics are present in our order book today and we expect continued demand to address these network requirements will result in a growing backlog as we move through the second half of the year.', '\nIn this environment our revenue is not a function of demand or even production capacity for that matter.', '\nIt also reflects significantly higher component costs and also higher logistics expense.', '\nMoving to profitability measures, we delivered adjusted operating margin of 11.', '\nWe continue to expect to repurchase approximately $250 million of shares in fiscal 2022 in addition to the ASR.', '\nDemand drivers are very robust, but as Gary said, in this environment, our revenue is not a function of demand, it is purely a matter of components supply availability.', '\nWith that, in Q3, we expect to deliver revenue in a range of $870 million to $930 million.', ""\nWith respect to the full fiscal year, we're adjusting our expectations for exactly the same reasons and with the same assumptions."", '\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions Your first question comes from a line of Paul Silverstein from Cowen.', ""\nSo we've had a very non-linear flow of orders."", '\nGary Smith -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSo Paul, the other thing I would add in terms of the linearity of orders.', ""\nSo that's why we talked to this very sustainable order flow demand."", ""\nJim Moylan -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd to your specific question about what our guide would have been, it's a number that is almost beyond the pale, Paul, because we've got backlog of over $4 billion, as Gary said, only a few $100 million of that is true 2023 demand."", ""\nPaul Silverstein -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nJim, just be clear, you all, I don't think you provided the backlog number, last quarter it was $2."", '\nWe came out of this quarter with over $4 billion.', '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from Evercore ISI.', '\nAmit Daryanani -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGood morning.', ""\nI think you've got a confluence of sort of three things going on, you've got a little bit of catch up, that certainly was the case sort of probably 12 months ago, where carriers were very conservative during COVID, both cons -- both from an operational perspective and from a fiscal perspective, they were playing a bit of catch up, that's largely flowed out."", ""\nAnd so the fact is that, when we get new orders, which we've had a ton of this year."", ""\nAmit Daryanani -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nFair enough and that's really helpful."", ""\nGary Smith -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nAmit, what -- I'll take the first part of that and then maybe Jim or Scott can talk to the actual sort of increase in cost."", ""\nSo I'm going to shorthand it at 45%."", '\nThat was our expectation coming into this year.', '\nSo you can do math and get to where you think our gross margin might be without these.', '\nAmit Daryanani -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nThank you.', '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Tim Long from Barclays.', '\nCan you tell us what that purchase commitment number was, and I think, if I recall correctly, we printed the 10-K, that number was about $430 million.', '\nNow, inventories are just inflecting in the last quarter or two.', '\nGary Smith -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nLet me take the first part of that, George, and maybe, Scott, can talk to the inventory a little more precisely.', '\nRevenues are up 14% in the quarter.', ""\nScott McFeely -- Senior Vice President of Global Products and Services\nAnd George, just to speak a little bit to the inventory position, a couple of dynamics there that are all rooted in conscious decisions and it really relates back to Jim's comment of we're not pleased with the way we're servicing our customers."", '\nSo if you could see inside that logic, you would have a different view of what our purchase can -- our total purchase commitments were even a year they have been a lot higher.', ""\nGary Smith -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThe other thing I'd add to that, George is that, I just remind everybody, that's rule component cost."", '\nGeorge Notter -- Barclays -- Analyst\nAs I think about the kind of manufacturing side of this, I know, for example, going back to OFC, we were talking to some of your customers.', ""\nJim Moylan -- Chief Financial Officer\nThat's revenue."", ""\nGary Smith -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThat's absolute revenue."", ""\nAnd then the other testament to it is the order flow, I don't think anybody is seeing the kind of order validation from the customers, knowing what our lead times are and we're still increasing our backlog."", ""\nAnd I think global scale and balance sheet and those relationships are absolutely critical to coming through this with a winning hand and that's what we're focused on."", '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Fahad Najam from Loop Capital.', ""\nGary Smith -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI say to that, we're not seeing that."", ""\nJim Moylan -- Chief Financial Officer\nOne thing I'd say though, Fahad, is this, that for a long, long time, this industry has grown at low-to-mid single digits overall."", ""\nSo we're not saying that this kind of order flow is going to continue for the long-term."", ""\nI would say this, I think, given what we think our backlog will be at the end of this year and assuming that our suppliers deliver on their commitments to us, we'll have a growth rate in revenue next year, that's well above the 6% to 8% than we've seen in the past and I can't give you a number on that."", ""\nFahad Najam -- Loop Capital Markets -- Analyst\nMy follow up is to kind of really piggyback on George's question on the extending lead times and the supply chain shortages."", '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Tim Long from Barclays.', '\nJim -- or Jim and Gary, the last guidance implied no decommits and when we look at the Q4 to get to the full year, looks like a pretty big sequential increase, probably, something like 20%.', ""\nJim Moylan -- Chief Financial Officer\nTim, I'll take the first part."", ""\nScott McFeely -- Senior Vice President of Global Products and Services\nAnd to your question about breaking down a little bit the dynamics that are going on in the routing and switching business, I'll say, say this just to repeat, the business itself was up 27% sequentially quarter on quarter and about 70% year on year, that's a combination of organic growth and inorganic growth with Vyatta."", '\nEnterprise connect, as Gary talked about enterprise connect into the cloud, a new space for us around residential access, getting all interest in the architecture there and then backing off from that, bringing all three of those use cases back deeper into the network, a common routing and switching

around the overall dynamics of what they're seeing to do."", ""\nAnd in terms of fulfilling what we've got, I think what we're trying to do right now is just really catch up with the backlog and the pent-up demand."", '\nBut I think you will see greater long-term visibility with our customers.', '\nDavid Vogt -- UBS -- Analyst\nGreat.', '\nHow would you handicap sort of that $250 million revenue shortfall, the likelihood of being able to capture that next year, given where lead times are and where commits are at this point and your purchase order commitments, right?', ""\nJim Moylan -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, I mean, if you just look at the delivery dates, it probably wouldn't be in next year's."", ""\nGary Smith -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nAnd I would just add that I think sort of, and again, we're not talking about 2023 right now."", '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs.', '\nSo I just wondered if maybe you could talk a little bit about dynamic -- the demand dynamics there?', '\nGovernment, it was a couple of larger projects that we delivered in the quarter.', '\nRod Hall -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nAnd you think, I mean, the government number, Gary, does that kind of ratchet back down again, April just was a pulses project oriented revenue or is that.', '\nI mean, I appreciate you highlighting it.', '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Tal Liani from Bank of America.', ""\nTal Liani -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nThe risk the things get canceled next year, because customers don't get the products."", ""\nJim Moylan -- Chief Financial Officer\nI don't think that's the driving force."", ""\nI think it's -- they're going to have the demand as long as their customers are demanding services from them, and as I said, we've seen no reduction in that."", ""\nGary Smith -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI think on the web-scale, specifically, there's no point building a data center, if you can't connect it."", '\nGary Smith -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI think, Tal, from the conversations that I personally have it, I think the opposite is actually true, frankly.', '\nSo the DIY stuff is actually more difficult than it was before.', '\nOperator\nYour final question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Raymond James.', '\nGregg Lampf -- Vice President, Investor Relations\nZR?', '\nGary Smith -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSo on the ZR side, Simon.', ""\nWe are fully engaged in those players and we expect

year-over-year growth, indicating ongoing digital transformation and migration initiatives across the industry."", '\nThis past quarter, we added the largest stock exchange in Mainland China as a customer and also welcomed a large state-owned financial and insurance company.', '\nWe continue to see the growth in demand for our platform, with thousands of users every quarter joining our free tier and trial offering, both in the cloud and self-managed.', '\nWe further enhanced the platform to include more security and ID management features, such as the SCIM standard for ID management and integration with HashiCorp Vault for Secrets Management.', ""\nSo we expanded our partners' integration, including Atlassian, Jira, PagerDuty, Datadog, and more, to improve collaboration and traceability across the delivery process."", ""\nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to Jacob Shulman, JFrog's CFO, to look more deeply at the Q1 financials."", '\nWe continue to see healthy growth in new customer additions, with the majority landing at the Pro or Pro X subscription levels.', '\nIn line with the pricing change, we offered customers the opportunity to renew at the current rate if they move to a higher subscription tier, and a number of customers renewed with multiyear agreements.', '\nR&D expense for the quarter was $11.', '\nAs expected, the spend on the free community offering stabilized during the quarter as we benefited from the infrastructure improvements made in prior quarters.', '\nWe continue to target a low- to mid-single-digit operating margin in the near future.', '\nCash flow from operations was $8.', '\nAs for guidance, for Q2, we expect revenue of $47.', '\nAt the midpoint, revenue growth is approximately 33%.', '\nSterling Auty -- J.',

Officer and Co-Founder\nLook, Q1 revenues were not impacted by the price increases mainly because of the fact that it applied from February 1.', '\nThe second thing is that the price increases that we have performed are very much aligned with the values that we created and injected into our subscription and also removed any kind of friction between the different subscriptions as you move on from one subscription to another on the JFrog self-hosted offering.', '\nSterling Auty -- J.', '\nOperator\nOur next question is from Jack Andrews from Needham.', ""\nShlomi Ben Haim -- Chief Executive

break the CI/CD flow if any vulnerable solution is being pushed."", '\nJack Andrews -- Needham & Company -- Analyst\nWell, I guess just broader Artifactory and just -- or your broader platform.',

Ader -- William Blair -- Analyst\nOK.', ""\nWhere do you see that going over the next, I don't know, four to six quarters?"", '\nOur annual guidance midpoint suggests 33% year over year ago, and that implies a net dollar retention of 130%.', '\nOperator\nOur next question is from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer.', '\nSo Shlomi, I want to kind of ask perhaps what, from your perspective, did not go right in the quarter?', '\nAnd I know that the JFrog growth and the JFrog efficiency go hand in hand.', '\nSo I never saw JFrog spending a dollar without the cost.', ""\nAnd we will do what's needed in order to keep the business as a business when needed to be profitable, it would be profitable when needed, it will have more investment."", '\nAnd we increased the team in Japan and in China and in India in order to support that.', '\nOperator\nAnd our next question is from Rob Owens from Piper Sandler.', '\nJust to remind that a significant portion of our revenue is coming from expansion of existing customers.', '\nIn the cloud, it will be the lower tier.', '\nOperator\nOur next question is from Peggy Yu from Morgan Stanley.', '\nHow much of that is coming from the pull-forward bookings because of enterprise hikes, pricing increase?', '\nIn the world of automation, CI/CD, I believe that this world is quite mature on the CI level and very premature on the CD, the continuous deployment level.', '\nThey start to appreciate the freedom of choice the developers demand.', '\nOperator\nAnd our last question is from Kingsley Crane from Berenberg.', '\nThey have the Bitbucket pipeline that replaced, I think, Bamboo, the CI server; Opsgenie and Jira, of course, to manage the administration and planning.', '\nSo I guess how should we think about the strategy behind the recent prices

referring to the non-GAAP financial measures.', '\nThe vast majority of the customers that I have spoken to understand that the cyber incident that affected us and others could have happened to any vendor, and especially a broadly deployed vendor like SolarWinds.', '\nWe hit a significant milestone that many companies aspire to, achieving non-GAAP revenues of over $1 billion in 2020.', '\nWe sustained strong maintenance renewal rates north of 90% in 2020, and the fourth-quarter renewal rates held up well despite the cyberattacks on SolarWinds, which we announced on December 14.', '\nWe expect SentryOne to help sustain that growth.', '\nWe ended the year with more than 25,000 MSP partners that service over 500,000 small, medium enterprise customers, reflecting our status as a leading provider of remote monitoring and management, security, data protection and business management solutions for MSPs around the world.', '\nMoving forward, the business will be known by a familiar name,

believe is critical to share is that we previously disclosed that the number of customers that may have installed an affected version of the Orion software platform was fewer than 18,000.', '\nTwo current sitting members of our board, who are CIOs with significant cybersecurity experience, and I form the three member committee.', '\nThis growth was driven by solid customer retention as evidenced by maintenance renewal rates of over 90% in the fourth quarter.', '\nOn-premises subscription sales resulted in an approximately 3-percentage-point headwind to our license revenue for the quarter.', '\nTotal ARR reached approximately $960 million as of December 31, 2020, reflecting year-over-year growth of 14%, which includes approximately 2 percentage points of contribution from our

cover dilution.', '\nWe continue to execute on our operational and financial playbook, delivering another strong quarter and a solid first-half performance.', '\nOn a sequential basis, the segment expanded operating EBIT margins by 810 basis points on continued local price gains in olefins and in packaging applications.', '\nMoving to the industrial intermediates and infrastructure segment, operating EBIT was nearly $650 million, up more than $860 million year over year, primarily due to the pandemic recovery, combined with tight supply and strong demand in both businesses.', '\nThe industrial solutions business delivered a net sales improvement compared to the year-ago period as a result of local price gains and offerings for coatings, industrial, and electronics end markets across all regions.', '\nOperating EBIT margins increased 760 basis points on price gains and strong consumer and industrial demand recovery.', '\nThe coatings and performance monomers business delivered higher net sales year over year, driven by price gains in all regions.', '\nIn our packaging and specialty plastics segment, downstream converter and brand owner inventories remain at all-time lows with balances very tight.', '\nWe also expect $30 million of additional planned maintenance turnaround spending at our joint ventures in the quarter.', '\nDemand for do-it-yourself architectural coatings remains robust, and we expect to see an increase in contractor-related demand as new home builds increase and consumer and home social engagements begin to resume.', '\nAs vaccination rates increase around the world and economies continue to reopen, pent-up consumer demand and increased personal savings built over the past year should also provide an additional boost to the global economy.', '\nThe personal care market, which has been one of the slowest to recover, began to see a rebound in the second quarter, with increases in U.', '\nPolyethylene demand growth, for example, is projected to outpace supply additions in the near term, with pricing strength and resilient margins on a sustained and favorable oil-to-gas ratio, with the majority of industry capacity adds coming in the higher end of the cost curve.', '\nFor example, as the mobility sector continues its transition to more sustainable solutions, electric and autonomous vehicles offer an upside of approximately 50% more revenue across multiple Dow chemistries versus traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, including high-value polyurethanes, silicones, and silicone hybrid-based adhesives and engineering sealants widely used in battery assembly, noise and vibration reduction, drivetrain, comfort and heat management applications.', '\nThis quarter, we outlined our road map to reduce CO2 emissions by more than 40% by 2030 from our manufacturing operations in Terneuzen, The Netherlands.', '\nCombined with favorable supply and demand fundamentals, these projects further enable Dow to continue to deliver significant value for our owners over this foreseeable future.', '\nOur value proposition starts with our differentiated portfolio and an asset base that is characterized by, first, our feedstock flexibility and position, which supports our low-cost position and enables us to drive higher asset utilization and maximize cash margins as we quickly balance our feedstock and product mix to supply end demand dynamics.', '\nAnd through value chain collaboration, we are increasing post-consumer recycled content in our products and enabling the design of fully recyclable packaging.', '\nWe also delivered a return on invested capital of greater than 14% on a trailing 12-month basis.', '\nAnd we continue to return significant cash to shareholders through our industry-leading dividend.', '\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions Our first question comes from P.', '\nAnd this was evident in your pricing, where U.', '\nJim

planned turnarounds."", ""\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank."", '\nIn some views, we probably had our highest raw material prices in the second quarter

be at $1."", ""\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets."", '\nJohn McNulty -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nYes.', '\nThe only caveat to that, I would say, is that there are still a couple of lines where some raw material supply limitations, small raw materials are important in making those products, sometimes cause us a little bit of a backlog.',

what they're doing and what they're requesting us to do as well because we are a supplier into ERCOT."", '\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Michael Sison with Wells Fargo.', ""\nSo I think you're going to see as carbon comes into the equation that it advantages plastics greatly."", '\nAnd so I just use a paper versus plastic scenario in a grocery store.', ""\nFor many, many decades, it's been in that one and a half type of GDP growth rate."", '\nSo I think we can sustain that over a long period of time, which is positive.', ""\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs."", ""\nAnd I think we're seeing real demand in taking recycled packaging products into some things that are more durable and longer-lived, building materials, using recycled plastics in aggregate for roadways, architectural decking, all kinds of things that are upgrading the use of end-of-life plastics."", '\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.', '\nI would say that is not a high enough price of carbon to drive the change that needs to be made because the lower carbon technologies are much more expensive than that.', ""\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets."", '\nArun Viswanathan -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGreat.', ""\nCould you just maybe remind us what your assumptions are on how much polyethylene capacity is being added in the rest of '21 and where that is coming, whether it be in, again, China or other regions?"", '\nLong term, right now, there are supply demand -- there are supply additions that are about 31 million metric tons on the books.', '\nAnd in the near term, with these GDP growth rates, things are going to be tight.', ""\nWe're doing work on our own FCDh technology and our EDH technology in the Gulf to try to have low carbon moves forward."", '\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Alex Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets.', ""\nBut nobody's yet, at a government level or any level, having the educated discussion that we need to have about the cost of doing this."", ""\nAnd the other thing to remember on hydrogen, is as you move to a hydrogen economy, the most effective way to make most of that hydrogen is through steam methane reforming which uses natural gas, which means you're going to need a lot more natural gas production to make that hydrogen."", '\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.', '\nIs there any opportunity that you see that downstream revenue could be enhanced from it?', '\nJim Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nGood question, Steve.', ""\nAnd what we're trying to work through are the right set of policies that we need to

easier for them to leverage the power of YouTube."", '\nMark Mahaney -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nThank you, Sundar, and thank you, Philipp.', ""\nAnd then for you, Philipp, people have been asking

very focused strategy.', ""\nWe are emerging from this pandemic, a much different company, a company that's focused, has digitally transformed itself, has powered up, top graded the management team, expanded our revenue producers significantly."", ""\nSo we think there's plenty of demand for us to have a very successful year."", '\nOperator\nOur next question comes from A.', ""\nI guess I'm just trying to figure out -- hi, everybody, first of all."", ""\nIs there a way to talk about how many of your placements that you're getting are going to COVID sort of hotspot, COVID specific assignments, versus non-COVID and how that will trend going into the fourth quarter."", ""\nIs there assignments that people token when they were under the gun and the peak of the surge in September and October, they just are going to extend into the fourth quarter because they're three-month plus assignments, and then they'll roll off."", '\nKevin C.', '\nWell, hi, A.', ""\nThe second backdrop in addition to COVID, this quarter, we are, as we called out, there are these vaccination mandates, and that's leading to an even tighter supply for pockets in the country."", ""\nAnd then one other comment, and

addition, the hospitals are starting business resumption.', ""\nAnd again, once we hit January, potentially we'll see flu, you'll start to see some of those, what was to be preventative services now becoming more in need and acute, and you'll start to see people working down their deductibles and going back for their deferred services."", '\nKevin C.', '\nJohn A.', ""\nAnd so while bill rates, fill rates are a hard indication to show what we're doing because there's just between the vaccine mandates, between the COVID needs, there are literally, there are thousands of openings in certain

call the shots.', ""\nSo many things go into -- I know we call that great guidance for fourth quarter, but we're still warming up the engines here at Cross Country Healthcare."", '\nAnd I can also reflect on the great sales quarter we had with our -- from our sales organization.', ""\nJohn, I don't know if you want to add anything from your perspective on that?"", '\nJohn A.', '\nAnd then second, it looks like, with my kind of back of a napkin math, somewhere between 20% and 30% productivity gains on your sales force relative to the prior year, depending on how much you attribute at WSG.', '\nKevin C.', '\nWilliam J.', ""\nSo because we're still gaining productivity, and we're still having our revenue producers ramp from the significant investments we've made throughout the year."", '\nWilliam J.', '\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Tobey Sommer from Truist Securities.', '\nTobey Sommer -- Truist Securities -- Analyst\nI was wondering if you could give us a little bit more granularity into the increase within the sales force itself because you did say 90% of a 30% increase of overall employees.', '\nWilliam J.', '\nKevin C.', '\nSo we are investing $12 million to $15 million a year in capital expenditures.', '\nAnd then in terms of your question around the mix of people, look, we have grown substantially our Cross Country nurses division recruiter base as

think it might be refrigerator stable.', ""\nBut again, that's probably too early to say."", '\nDo We actually need to maybe do redose or revaccinate sooner than eight to six months because of where

booster studies, no longer have detectable neutralizing immunity against the variants of concern.', '\nThat probably looks like boosting on a nine to 12 months after primary series as an annual booster for now.', ""\nBecause I don't think that you can just make it."", '\nI already believe the IP topic is mostly critically driven.', ""\nWe have completed GMP manufacturing of all of those

""\nNow that's not to say that mRNA-1273 as a booster couldn't -- wouldn't provide a benefit, and I think you're highlighting that, Gena."", ""\nBut if you had to choose between the two, and you were primarily concerned about increasing immunity to a higher level so that it can last longer, particularly in patient populations at high risk of either waning immunity or incomplete immunity, we think this starts to provide very early event, even at Day 15, even after a priming dose, that there's going to be an advantage to some strain matching of the antigen."", ""\nAnd then, the second question is, when the next-gen vaccines for COVID-19, when you have some permutations, what's the potential to leverage the technology to use different parts of the virus versus just modifying the spike protein or do you think this could add regulatory steps that make it difficult, even if it's theoretically possible."", '\nAnd so we are probably not going to have a chance to wait for data for cases

increased by about $141,000 on a quarter-over-quarter basis primarily driven by slightly higher management and incentive fees earned by our advisor during the current quarter.', '\nMoving on to net

starting on Slide 7.', '\nNext on Slide 8, sales in our Consumer Packaging North America division were $680 million in the quarter, which was 13% higher than the December 2018 quarter as a result of the addition of the North American Rigid business from the RPC acquisition along with better-than-expected organic volume growth of 3%, as the business has continued executing its long-term strategy focusing on advantaged products in targeted markets.', '\nOperating EBITDA for the division in the quarter was $121 million, compared to $88 million in the prior year quarter, this 38% increase was primarily driven by the contributions in the RPC acquisition including synergies from the combination and continued organic volume growth.', '\nOperating EBITDA decreased by $18 million from the prior year quarter, when adjusted for the sale of the Seal for Life business, this decrease was consistent with our expectation as highlighted on our last earnings call as a result of unfavorable price/cost spread and the lost earnings from the customer product transition.', '\nNext, on Slide 10 sales, for our Engineered Materials division was $585 million for the quarter, compared to $661 million and the prior year quarter.', '\nOperating EBITDA in our Engineered Materials division was $106 million, compared to $126 million in the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of unfavorable price/cost

the quarter, compared to $161 million in the December 2018 quarter, increasing over 35% primarily from incremental cash flow resulting from the RPC acquisition.', '\nOur free cash flow for the December 2019 quarter was in line with the prior year quarter of $70 million.', '\nAlso during the quarter, we refinanced $4.', '\nOur fiscal year 2020 free cash flow guidance and assumptions are

perspective, but I would know any time we do an acquisition and with a portfolio of the size of Berry's, as well prior to the acquisition of RPC, we're constantly looking at the portfolio and determining if there's areas that ultimately are going to be prioritized relative to our growth objectives, relative to paring or shedding businesses that's an active process that we undertake and at a point in time that we have anything to share that is actionable, we'll be certain to share on our future call."", '\nThomas E.', ""\nYes, that's good question again."", '\nAnd the fact that we saw growth across such a diverse number of segments gives us a great deal of confidence.', '\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs.', ""\nAnd then just sort of related it that, if 30% of that Consumer International business is sort of more industrial facing, maybe why not put that in the EM segment or break it out a little bit separately, because it does

2021.', '\nsaw particularly strong results at 46% growth, and international grew low double digits on a constant currency basis, in line with our long-term expectation, and 24% when normalized for one-time revenues in the UK during the first quarter of 2021.', '\nThese first-quarter results are excellent but are not new for us.', '\nFor 2022, we now expect to generate revenues of $770 million to $780 million, representing year-over-year growth of 20% to 21.', '\nWe believe that our continued success in new business, upsell from new products such as identity, and client retention, make us a resilient company through different cycles.', '\nPeter will speak about our new business growth and M&A execution in the course of his financial discussion of the quarter and guidance.', '\nThese simplified and streamlined experiences help us win new business and enable us to have strong retention of our existing client base.', '\nIn the first quarter, we added a new self-service Check My Status Tool, which provides candidates with a quick streamlined way to check the current status of their background check, including target dates for completion by email notification.', '\nOur exclusive partnerships with FINRA and ID.', ""\nClients can continue to use their existing provider for collection, in which case we still process and channel the fingerprints on FINRA's behalf."", '\nEven more importantly, the FINRA deal is a testament to our leadership in the identity space and is serving as a strong lead generation tool within the financial services industry.', '\nWhen clients are made aware that it is not, the interest of adopting identity services is significant.', '\nDuring the first quarter, we saw significant momentum in identity verification.', '\nGiven that we are in the very nation stages of adding identity to our background packages, we are very excited about the opportunity this presents for our business.', '\nThe organic revenue increase included over 20% of base revenue growth, including cross-sell, upsell, net of attrition, and approximately 10% of new customer growth.', ""\nNotably, the first quarter's revenues from new business was a solid sequential increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2021."", '\nBase growth also continues to be a significant contributor to our results due to a strong labor market and secular tailwinds, such as remote work, millennial churn, and continued growth of the gig economy, which are driving increased labor turnover.', '\nAs we executed our growth playbook and the U.', '\nRevenue in our international business grew by 11% on an organic constant currency basis, solidly within our long-term expectations with three points of impact from currency fluctuations.', ""\nWe're very pleased with this performance as it was above our expectations, driven by strong base growth and client retention."", '\nAdjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter of 2022 was approximately 25%.', '\nThis growth is primarily driven by strong year-over-year revenue growth and operating income.', '\nWe continue to expect full-year free cash flow conversion of adjusted EBITDA of 45% to 50% similar to the rate achieved in 2021.', '\nIn terms of capital allocation, our priorities have not changed since the time of our IPO, investing into organic revenue growth, pursuing M&A, and maintaining a healthy balance sheet.', '\nThe success of this deal and integration provide us with confidence that we are well-prepared to pursue additional M&A.', '\nAs shown on Slide 15, our guidance includes full-year organic constant currency revenue growth of 14.', ""\nAs Josh mentioned, we have not seen any significant impact from macroeconomic slowdown but we're being thoughtful in our forecasts, and have thus incorporated some possibility of economic slowdown into our 2022 guidance."", '\nMoreover, the benefits from margins from better than expected organic revenue growth is being balanced by a few items.', '\nAnd third, related to this incremental hiring, wage inflation for entry-level workers has picked up since our March earnings call.', '\nFinally, turning to our adjusted net income growth

and part of what we're saying there is, longer term, we do think that we have very, very valuable data that could be used in other contexts, not even necessarily just in background screening."",

seeing any of these trend of cost control measures within your verticals that you said or maybe within your customer base."", ""\nSo in Inaudible, you know, they may pull back on their hiring of people who are on W-2s, you know, as employees but we're not seeing them pull back on onboarding deliverers or drivers or caretakers."", ""\nAnd so you know, I think as Peter said, you know, if that

"""\nDico Akseraylian -- Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Ocwen's preliminary fourth-quarter 2020 earnings and business update call."", '\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide a useful supplement to analysis of our financial condition and an alternate way to view certain aspects of our business that is instructive.', ""\nWe've executed an incredible business transformation."", '\nWe believe our alliance with Oaktree can enable a level of growth and EPS accretion, and potential value creation that we cannot achieve on a stand-alone basis, as well as, support the refinancing of our corporate debt.', '\nWe concluded through our strategic review that our ability to increase the leverage of the total company using the assets of the operating company was limited by a number of factors, including proposed regulatory requirements that may increase capital and liquidity requirements for nonbank mortgage companies.', '\nWhen combined with MAV, we expect the over $460 million in capital provided by Oaktree can enable us to potentially increase our earnings per share by 65% or more once the proceeds are fully invested.', ""\nNow let's turn to Slide 7 for some of the details on MAV and the Holdco notes."", '\nThis is a substantially reduced collateral coverage and more deeply subordinated position in our capital structure versus our existing high-yield notes.', '\nThe Oaktree notes have a face value of $285 million with a $35 million original issue discount for net proceeds of $250 million.', '\nWe expect less restrictive covenants, eliminating amortization, and relative to existing corporate debt, extending the maturity with an expected tenure of six years on the Holdco notes.', '\nAs we announced in December, we formed a partnership joint venture with Oaktree Capital to launch an MSR asset vehicle.', '\nSo that gives us the capacity for up to about $60 billion in MSR UPB.', '\nIn terms of benefits, MAV supports our servicing and subservicing growth objectives on a capital-efficient basis and will help generate increased cost efficiency through increased origination and servicing scale.', '\nThis translates to over a 65% increase above our potential baseline EPS range which assumes an after-tax ROE range of roughly 10% to 15% on about $414 million of equity.', '\nWe expect to source roughly up to $200 billion in incremental total volume over the next couple of years.', ""\nLook, the bottom line here is, we're really excited about our alliance with Oaktree and the opportunity it provides to enable a level of growth and EPS accretion and potential value creation that we could not achieve on a stand-alone basis."", '\nAnnualized adjusted pre-tax profitability has improved over $380 million over the second-quarter 2018 baseline for Ocwen and PHH combined.', ""\nAnd as we talked about earlier, we're focused on accelerating our growth trajectory in 2021."", '\nSo again, just great performance by the team in really rethinking and reimagining our business infrastructure.', ""\nWe remain steadfast in our belief that the CFPB's claims regarding Ocwen's past servicing practice are unsubstantiated and the bureau settlement demands do not reflect the merits of this case."", '\nFull-year flow and co-issue originations were up 8 times over last year.', '\nAs I mentioned before, cash yields and MSRs continued to be very strong, and our portfolio replenishment was exceptional.', '\nOur call center continued to outperform the MBA reported industry averages.', '\nAll our hard work over the last two years really positions us well for profitable growth, leveraging a scale -- a scalable and efficient platform for 2021.', '\nAs well, the millennial generation is driving significant growth in the number of first-time potential homebuyers which should, long-term, also bode well for the purchase market.', '\nWe expect the increase in Ginnie Mae workouts as foreclosure alternatives will drive increased EBO, early buyout gain opportunities, in Ginnie Mae servicing, and the current low interest rate environment can create opportunities to drive increased realization of gains for executing call rights.', '\nThe increase in MSR values, this rate rise will positively impact book value per share.', ""\nYeah, from a regulatory perspective, we are monitoring and we'll continue to evaluate the impact that the Biden administration's key agenda items may have on our industry."", '\nWe expect the successful execution of our key initiatives will allow us to deliver positive GAAP earnings in 2021, with low double-digit to mid-teen after tax ROEs again by mid-2021, assuming no adverse changes in the market, industry or business conditions or legal and regulatory matters.', '\nWe believe our broad portfolio of services, including subservicing, specialty servicing, MSR purchase through multiple delivery methods, provides a compelling value

presentation, you talk about low-digit -- low double-digit to mid-teen after-tax return on equity.', '\nGlen Messina -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, Lee, based on the current $414 million of equity capital at Ocwen, our current book value per share and this is on Page 27 of the presentation for future reference is $47.', '\nLee Cooperman -- Omega Family Officer -- Investor\nOK.', ""\nGlen Messina -- Chief Executive Officer\nUm, I don't think so, Lee."", '\nSo our low double-digit to mid-teen returns is really focused on the $414 million of equity.', '\nGlen Messina -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, Lee, we think it will take about two years to fully invest all the proceeds that are coming in from Oaktree, both in terms of MAV, as well as, the on book capital.', '\nLee Cooperman -- Omega Family Officer -- Investor\nOK.', '\nLee Cooperman -- Omega Family Officer -- Investor\nOK.', ""\nGlen Messina -- Chief Executive Officer\nLook, it's got to be -- you know, certainly, market

we will continue to be passionate and resolute in driving an industry best practice cost structure in the business which helps offset our cost of capital as it exists today.', '\nGlen Messina -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, Lee, one of the benefits of having this incremental capital come in to support on-book MSR investments is on-book MSR has generated great cash flow.', '\nOperator\nOperator instructions Our next question is from Marco Rodriguez with Stonegate Capital Markets.', '\nOur enterprise sales team does a great job selling that.', '\nSo look, the enterprise sales model for us has

CBRE's fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call."", ""\nBefore I begin, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties."", '\nWe have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, fee revenue, certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of the presentation slide deck.', '\nNow please turn to Slide 4, which highlights our fourth quarter 2020 and full-year financial results.', '\nNow for insights on results in our longer-term strategy, please turn to Slide 6 as I turn the call over to Bob.', '\nToday, CBRE is more diversified than ever before across four key dimensions: property types, lines of business, geographic markets and clients.', '\nGeographically, New York, London and San Francisco are key markets for us, but our presence in Asia is robust and growing and our significant activity in Europe and second tier U.', '\nOur broad diversification across these four key dimensions has served us well compared with prior downturns.', ""\nWe built our long-term plan on the assumption that office demand remains under pressure due to a lasting increase in remote working and occupiers' needs for greater flexibility and space obligations."", '\nOne growth area we are particularly high on is flexible office space.', '\nNow, Leah will discuss the quarter and our outlook for 2021.', '\nGlobal leasing revenue declined about 28% as occupiers around the world continued to defer leasing decisions due to the pandemic.', '\nAdvisory sales improved notably from Q3, but remain 15% below Q4 2019 levels.', '\nCommercial mortgage origination revenue rose 49% in the quarter, reflecting a surge in GSE lending, particularly targeted at affordable housing.', '\nValuation revenue grew about 4% reflecting increased assignments for investor clients, particularly in Continental Europe, North Asia and Pacific.', '\nFor example, our focus on specialized services for life sciences and healthcare assets resulted in a 240 basis point increase in revenue contribution from these clients in these sectors in 2020.', '\nDevelopment adjusted EBITDA rose to over $67 million, reflecting an elevated level of industrial asset sales in the quarter.', ""\nLastly, Hana's adjusted EBITDA loss of over $10 million was slightly more than that in Q3."", '\nAcross the rest of Advisory, we expect high single-digit revenue growth with property management and mortgage origination leading the gains.', '\nMoving to GWS.', '\nLooking at REI.', '\nWe also envision targeted investments this year to expand our geographic reach, deepen our position in growth sectors and accelerate future growth, including a new initiative to launch in industrial and logistics development capability in Continental Europe.', '\nFor our U.', ""\nTurning to Slide 13, our track record over the last decade and, notably, over the last 12 months has proven the resiliency of CBRE's business and provides the foundation for enduring average annual earnings growth of, at a minimum, low double-digits through at least 2025 with meaningful upside potential from additional capital allocation."", '\nGiven our diversified business mix, we expect strong organic growth in key parts of our business to more than offset lower demand for office space as hybrid work models result in smaller corporate footprint.', '\nFinally, we intend to dynamically allocate our capital, while preserving our investment-grade credit rating to deliver the best risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.', ""\nWith that, please turn to Slide 14 and I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some closing remarks."", '\nThese direct reports include Tim Dismond, who was named Chief Diversity Officer last year.', '\nLate last year, we committed to science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets with the goal of cutting our emissions by more than two-thirds by 2035.', '\nSteve Sakwa -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nThanks, good morning, Leah and Bob.', ""\nAnd, yes, we believe that we'll be moving in the direction of elements of our business across those four dimensions that have secular advantage or at least neutral as it relates to being resilient."", ""\nLeah Stearns -- Chief Financial Officer\nNo, I would just add, Steve, that from my perspective, this is really about ensuring that we're seeking to achieve the best total return from the investments that we make."", '\nSteve Sakwa

opportunities across all three sectors and I'm going to highlight one that surprised everybody a year and a half ago when we did the Telford Homes acquisition in the U."", '\nAnthony Paolone -- J.', '\nAnthony Paolone -- J.', '\nOperator\nThe next question is from Rick Skidmore from Goldman Sachs.', ""\nBob Sulentic -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, I'm going to make a broad comment on that, Rick, and then I'm going to let Leah comment more specifically."", ""\nLeah Stearns -- Chief Financial Officer\nSo we've taken a hard look at what we believe to be the impact to office for our business and we certainly expect that to create some headwind from the secular decline."", '\nOperator\nThe next question is from Jade Rahmani from KBW.', '\nBob Sulentic -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, Jade, we always are open to M&A that would be adjacent to our business; not far adjacent but near adjacent to our business.', ""\nI think you will remember three years or so ago we did a -- in our Investment Management business, we did an infrastructure investment acquisition that we're very happy with and I think that gives us opportunity for expansion but we try to stay within our footprint, for the most part, when we do M&A."", '\nJade Rahmani -- Keefe Bruyette & Woods -- Analyst\nAnd semantically speaking, are you looking to strategies that would be considered more asset-light-type businesses or would the majority of opportunities include balance sheet capital intensive businesses such as the Telford?', ""\nBob Sulentic -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, well, Telford is not particularly an asset-heavy business, we'll have small co-investments in that like we do in the rest of our Development business."", ""\nLeah Stearns -- Chief Financial Officer\nSo in terms of Hana, we have invested approximately -- I have to get you the exact number, Jade, but in terms of the current year, we had a loss of about $40 million related to Hana and I'll get you the balance sheet number."", ""\nWe expect that the total run rate benefit from the $214 million of investment will be around $369 million of cost that's being offset in '21 by the resumption of -- we have some temporary costs that were cut in 2020 that will come back."", '\nOperator\nThe next question is from Stephen Sheldon from William Blair.', '\nBob Sulentic -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI would say one thing COVID has done to everybody is anything they can do to streamline their business, make it simpler, cut cost is front and center for them.', ""\nSo we think that means for companies like Industrious, in particular Industrious, who has a offering that's very high-quality data security-oriented toward corporate users, that there is going to be big demand for what they do."", '\nOperator\nThe next question is from Michael Funk from Bank of America.', '\nLeah Stearns -- Chief Financial Officer\nMichael, when we look at our forecast each year, we do factor in our recent performance as it relates to recruiting, as well as market share.', ""\nMichael Funk -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nAnd then I think in your prepared remarks, I think you mentioned that you're going to be reinvesting some of the savings from 2020 into opex in 2021."", '\nLeah Stearns -- Chief Financial Officer\nBut I would say a key part of our transformation initiative and the principle behind that was to ensure that we were reducing costs in certain areas however that we were -- that would preserve our ability to maintain industry-leading margins as we invest into the opportunities in the secular tailwinds that we see presenting themselves as a result of coming out of COVID.', '\nMichael Funk -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nAnd do you think that would be additive to the activity in the stronger property types or do you think that would somewhat cannibalize that activity as capital moves to other property types?', ""\nLeah Stearns -- Chief Financial Officer\nI don't see it as being cannibalistic."", ""\nOperator\nThe next question is from Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James."", ""\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nHey, good morning."", ""\nBob Sulentic -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWe can, Patrick, and it's very much tied to that broad base of business we do across those four dimensions and the fact that we see an awful lot of opportunity out there when we do our M&A work to do business with companies that we can help and can help us but they simply aren't the type of company for one reason or another that we should be buying in whole."", ""\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nGreat, that's helpful commentary."", ""\nLeah Stearns -- Chief Financial Officer\nSo near

"'\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to MINISO Group Holding Limited earning conference call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 that ended March 31, 2022.', '\nJoining us today are our founder and CEO, Mr.', ""\nPlease also note that we will discuss non-IFRS measures today, which we have explained and reconciled to the most comparable measures reported under the International Financial Reporting Standards in the company's earnings release and filings with the SEC."", '\nAccording to our estimates, nationwide footprints to our MINISO stores decreased by about 2% -- 14% and 34% on a year-over-year basis from January to March, respectively, due to the strict control measures by local governments.', '\nJack Ye -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n[Foreign language\nUnknown speaker\nSo, as we have emphasized in our earnings conference call over the past few quarters, the pandemic will weigh on consumer demand, and thus, our near-term results.', '\nDuring the same time, our market share in China has also increased from 10.', ""\nJack Ye -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nForeign language\nUnknown speaker\nI'm pleased to see several positive trends in our business and let me share with you."", '\nAnd we are pleased to see this trend of year-over-year increase in gross margin continued in April.', ""\nJack Ye -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nForeign language\nUnknown speaker\nSecondly, benefit from the pandemic control in many overseas countries and regions, MINISO's overseas business continued to recover."", '\nJack Ye -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nForeign language\nUnknown speaker\nThirdly, global retail industry is challenged by cost pressure as many countries, including the US, are entering one of the highest inflation in four decades.', '\nJack Ye -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nForeign language\nUnknown speaker\nTo tackle the global inflation, we will continue to leverage our core capabilities in supply chain and ensure the value proposition of MINISO product globally.', '\nJack Ye -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nForeign language\nUnknown speaker\nMeanwhile, we are capable to maintain a healthy level inventory.', '\nJack Ye -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nForeign language\nUnknown speaker\nIn March quarter in China, revenue of MINISO brand was CNY 1.', '\nJack Ye -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nForeign language\nUnknown speaker\nIn our earnings call last quarter, we introduced the roadmap of the strategic upgrade for MINISO brand.', '\nJack Ye -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nForeign language\nUnknown speaker\nMINISO is strategically committed to deepening consumer engagement and driving repurchases by providing improved omnichannel experience to them.', '\nBased on our AB testing, the average incremental spending of customers after they become pay members is encouraging.', '\nGMV growth in distributed markets were even higher.', '\nJack Ye -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nForeign language\nUnknown speaker\nWe added 39 stores on a net basis in the March quarter compared to 29 stores a year ago.', '\nJack Ye -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nForeign language\nUnknown speaker\nIn overseas markets, 74 stores or 4% of our total overseas stores have not resumed operations as of March 31 quarter on quarter.', '\nJack Ye -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nForeign language\nUnknown speaker\nNow let me introduce the development of TOP TOY.', '\nJack Ye -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nForeign language\nUnknown speaker\nIn the long term, we see huge potential of TOP TOY market.', '\nJack Ye -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nForeign language\nUnknown speaker\nThe fast growth of TOP TOY market in China is laid on four pillars.', '\nJack Ye -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nForeign language\nUnknown speaker\nIn March quarter, merchandise gross margin of TOP TOY reached a healthy level of 45%, improved sequentially.', ""\nJack Ye -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nForeign language\nUnknown speaker\nTaking Sanrio, MINISO's long-term partner of IP co-branding as an example."", '\nJack Ye -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nForeign language\nUnknown speaker\nIn addition, TOP TOY continued to focus on potential categories such as toy bricks.', '\nRevenue for March quarter was CNY 2.', ""\nAs we have mentioned in CEO's prepared remarks, in China, in this quarter, revenue from offline business of MINISO brand grew by 1% year over year."", '\nHowever, considering the strong replacement demand from the overseas market after an encouraging GMV growth this quarter, and considering that more stores will be opened in the coming quarters, we expect a decent growth of shipment revenue to overseas in the coming quarters.', '\nThe stronger seasonality in March quarter of 2022 is a proof of continued recovery in overseas market.', '\nAs you know, our overseas operation usually have a higher gross margin than our operation in China.', '\nExcluding share-based compensation expense, selling and distribution expense was CNY 352 million, increased by 28% year over year and decreased by 5% quarter over quarter.', '\n3, increased promotion and advertising expense in relating to refresh of the MINISO store in China, partially offset by decreased logistics expense.', '\nThe quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily due to decreased personnel-related expense and decreased financial and legal service fee.', '\nAdjusted net profit was CNY 111 million compared to CNY 149 million in the same period of 2021 and CNY 205 million in the previous quarter.', '\nAs of March end, the combined balance of our cash, cash equivalents, and the restricted cash and other investments was CNY 5.', '\nTrade receivables remained stable on both year over year and quarter-over-quarter basis.', '\nAs it is difficult to predict when the lockdown measure will come to end, we remain cautious in our outlook for the June quarter.', ""\nAs we have shared in CEO's prepared remarks, we have not faced any material cost headwinds, thanks to our strong bargaining power and our flexible pricing strategy."", '\nWe will continue to focus on those elements of our business that are under our control to drive growth and protect margins.', '\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\nYour first question today comes from the line of Michelle Cheng from Goldman Sachs.', '\nMichelle Cheng -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nForeign language So I have two questions for management.', '\nJack Ye -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nForeign language\nUnknown speaker\nI will translate for CEO.', '\nAnd there is more and more freight pressures coming on the way.', ""\nThis part only accounts for a relatively small proportion of the total trade cost and the freight from MINISO's warehouse to the domestic MINISO Retail Partner stores or our distributor stores, they are charged to corresponding retail partners or distributors."", '\nAnd our long-term mutually beneficial relationship with our suppliers has enabled us strong and enough marketing power to consolidate our cost advantages.', ""\nAs I shared earlier, the inventory turnover days range is at 60 to 70 days and very close to our pre-COVID level, specifically in FY '19, our inventory turnover days was 63 days and in fiscal year '22 and '21, it was about 78 due to the COVID."", '\nSteven Zhang -- Chief Financial Officer\nForeign language\nUnknown speaker\nI will translate for CFO.', ""\nAnd the basic principle here is that we will focus on the long-term health of the whole MINISO system and we'll grow based on that to adjust our store openings."", '\nHow should we think about potential impact on sales in the consumption downcycle?', ""\nJack Ye -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nForeign language\nUnknown speaker\nI'll translate for CEO."", ""\nWith our experience and core capabilities in supply chain, inventory management, and our pricing strategy, we'll continue to leverage our value proposition and cost advantage and get more capacity position in this downturn for consumer."", '\nFor the rest, 70% of MINISO products, we will stick to our value proposition.', ""\nSo we won't raise MINISO's product price completely, but we'll do that based on our value proposition and do some differentiated pricing to meet the more diversified consumer demands."", ""\nAnd as we communicated in last quarter's earnings call, I really hope that after brand upgrade when consumers come to MINISO store, they won't feel that we got more expensive, but we have more value."", '\nSteven Zhang -- Chief Financial Officer\nForeign language\nUnknown speaker\nI will translate for CFO.', '\n1, the temporary store closure is even higher.', ""\nAnd for the operations in May in China, we saw some kind of recovery, but our judgment is that it's more related to seasonality as May is traditional a strong month for MINISO."", '\nEntering into the June quarter, we have seen apparently acceleration in the whole recovery in overseas market.', '\nSo in March due to the COVID and the control measures, our inventory was negatively affected a little bit.', ""\nVeronica Song -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nForeign language Maybe I'll quick translate."", '\nAnd the store number increased by 70% year on year.', '\nSo it has still lingering effect on our sales there.']"
"""\nSpeaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, and he will be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri."", ""\nPlease note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the company's business and results of operations."", '\nBut before we dive more deeply into the numbers, I want to speak just for a bit on COVID-19.', '\nBefore COVID-19 was on the horizon, we anticipated that Q2 was going to be a prolific and energetic period for Apple.', ""\nAt the same time that they were leaving no stone unturned to get our latest generation of devices manufactured and into our customers' hands, our worldwide network of supply chain partners, logistics and operations folks in every part of the company were also sourcing more than 30 million masks for frontline medical workers, ensuring they're donated to places of greatest need in every region around the world."", '\nIn a quarter, where our Services teams achieved strong growth, which Luca will dig into in a minute and which speaks to the real durability of our services strategy, these teams were also putting COVID-19 front and center.', '\nIn software, at the same time that our teams work with great creativity and excitement as we prepare to deliver our first-ever all-online Worldwide Developers Conference later this quarter, they also worked with the same creativity and speed to put together our COVID-19 symptom checking website and app, in partnership with the CDC.', '\nDuring a quarter where circumstances evolve by the hour, we have been gratified by the resilience and adaptability of our global supply chain.', '\nNow, when you step back and tally all this up, when you consider all the ways COVID-19 has touched Apple, our customers and the way we work, this may not have been the quarter it could have been absent this pandemic.', '\nIn the next five weeks of the quarter, as COVID-19 started impacting China, iPhone supply was temporarily affected, as well as demand for our products within China.', ""\nWith that, I'll hand things off to Luca."", '\nIt has been a very different quarter than we were expecting when we last talked to you at the end of January, but we could not be more proud of our Apple teams around the world, our role in supporting local communities and our partners throughout the value chain, and how resilient our business and financial performance has been during these challenging times.', '\nSo the revenue for the quarter was $58.', '\nServices revenue followed a different trend with very strong year-over-year growth of 17%.', '\nServices gross margin was 65.', '\nLet me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories.', '\nOn the demand side, after a very strong first five weeks, we saw the impact of COVID-19 affect demand in China for the next five weeks and then more broadly around the world for the last three weeks of the quarter when lockdowns and point-of-sale closures became more widespread in many countries.', '\nApp Store revenue grew by strong double digits, thanks to robust customer demand for both in-app purchases and subscriptions.', '\nWe now have over 515 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 125 million from a year ago.', '\nWearables, Home and Accessories established a new March quarter record, with revenue of $6.', ""\nNext, I'd like to talk about Mac and iPad."", '\nLet me now turn to our cash position.', ""\nFinally, as we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to provide some color on what we are seeing, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call."", '\nFrom a foreign exchange standpoint, the US dollar has appreciated recently against most currencies around the world, and as a result, we expect our revenue to be negatively impacted by more than $1.', '\nFor gross margin, sequential headwinds include foreign exchange, the mix within products and the seasonal loss of leverage on our product business.', '\nWe are in the midst of developing our most exciting pipeline of products and services ever while contributing over $350 billion to the US economy and expanding our footprint in many cities around the country over a five-year period.', ""\nFinally, and most importantly, we are managing Apple for the long term as we've always done."", '\n[Operator Instructions\nOperator, may we have the first question, please?', '\nShannon Cross -- Cross Research -- Analyst\nThank you very much for taking my question.', '\nAnd from a demand point of view, we saw an improvement in March over February.', '\nIn particular for, as I think Luca shared, we believe that iPad and Mac are going to improve on a year-over-year basis during this quarter.', '\nLuca Maestri -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes, well, Shannon, as we said, we manage the company for the long term, right.', '\nAnd so we will try to balance the need to continue to invest during difficult circumstances and the fact that we like to manage the business wisely.', ""\nBut as you can tell from what we did this quarter, despite the environment, we have our head down, are working because we know that our customers want the products that we've got."", '\nKaty Huberty -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nThank you for the question.', '\nTim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer\nI think there are things from just a great reminder of how important our products are and -- for remote work.', '\nOn the health area, I gave some examples in my opening comments about the ECG being used on the Watch.', '\nAnd as you look at our run rate during the last several years, you know that that is a very adequate amount.', '\nAmit Daryanani -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nThanks for taking my question.', ""\nAmit Daryanani -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nThat's really helpful."", '\nGiven the overall economic environment, the level of demand right now, there are two businesses that we believe are going to be impacted during the June quarter.', '\nThe other business which we think is going to be impacted by the overall economic weakness and the uncertainty on when businesses will reopen is advertising, which is the sum of our advertising business on the App Store, on Apple News and the third-party agreements that we have on the advertising front.', ""\nTim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer\nI haven't seen what you're asking, no."", ""\nOperator\nThat will be from JP Morgan's Samik Chatterjee."", '\nSamik Chatterjee -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\nHi, thanks for taking the question.', '\nTo your question about store traffic, store traffic is obviously up from where it was in February, but it is not back to where it was pre the lockdown.', '\nSamik Chatterjee -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\nGot it.', '\nTim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer\nI think it plays in every geo, but I would expect to see it doing even better in areas where the median incomes are less.', ""\nTim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer\nChris, we've always been about delivering the best product at a good price, and that fundamental strategy has not changed at all.""]"
"'\nWe may also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to the nearest comparable GAAP measure in the appendix of the earnings announcement.', ""\nWith that, I'll give the floor to Barry to begin his comments."", '\nIn addition, capacity in the first quarter increased by 20% versus the comparable pre-COVID quarter in 2019.', ""\nAs we position the airline to be a leader in the post-pandemic recovery, we are focused on balancing capacity in response to elevated fuel prices and the current demand environment to enable the airlines' return to profitability in the second quarter and full year 2022."", '\nUtilization should continue to improve as the overall passenger volumes increased through year-end.', ""\nThis new service complements our existing operations at

almost $0.', ""\nBefore we move to questions, I'd like to comment on our pending merger with Spirit Airlines."", '\nFor employees, we expect the combination to create 10,000 new direct jobs and thousands more at our business partners.', '\nDuane Pfennigwerth -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nHey, thanks.', ""\nBarry Biffle -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I think we've been pretty

different model, sort of a transactional kind of approach.', ""\nTed Sarandos -- Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chief Content Officer\nIt's interesting when you challenge the people to figure out, one of the great things about the subscription model is I think it opens up for consumers to be much more adventurous about what they watch."", ""\nKannan Venkateshwar -- Barclays -- Analyst\nAnd I guess when you have this kind of content volume and also the kind of movie slate that you're putting up, it also gives you a lot more pricing power because instead of watching a movie for $10 or as a family for $30, you essentially pay for Netflix."", '\nAnd if we think we do that well, then we think our business will grow in turn.', '\nAnd I think the rhythm and the pace of that has been really keeping up.', '\nSpence Neumann -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd just the recent data points, Kannan, we referenced in the letter, but we had price increases in the U.', ""\nAnd we've grown nicely through that because I think to this point, we're continuing to increase the variety and value of what we're delivering for our members."", ""\nKannan Venkateshwar -- Barclays -- Analyst\nAnd I guess, on the pricing front, I mean, at a certain level, the elasticity -- and there's some action a research on this."", ""\nThose are the things that we're really looking for that are key to basically saying, OK, we've added more value in the service."", ""\nKannan Venkateshwar -- Barclays -- Analyst\nAnd just looking at the rest of the world, I mean, there's been a lot of small transactions."", ""\nSo there's been interesting assets which could have helped you scale potentially faster but obviously passed on it or did not really show any interest in these assets."", ""\nTed Sarandos -- Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chief Content Officer\nI would just add that historically, we've been builders, not buyers."", '\nSpencer Wang -- Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development\nWe have time for one more question, please.', '\nReed Hastings -- Co-Chief Executive Officer\nI think it was directed to Spencer.', '\nSpence Neumann -- Chief Financial Officer\nI could take a stab at it.', '\nI think the other part of your question was is there anything that we sort of regret.', ""\nTed Sarandos -- Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chief Content Officer\nI think for the -- with the hours and hours of joy we're bringing to hundreds of millions of people around the world and with the return to our shareholders, it's hard to look back with much regret."", ""\nKannan Venkateshwar -- Barclays -- Analyst\nThat's a good note to end on, I guess."", '\nReed Hastings -- Co-Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Kannan, and thank you to all of our shareholders, and look forward to talking to you in another quarter.', '\nSpence Neumann -- Chief Financial Officer\nOK.', '\nTed Sarandos -- Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chief Content Officer\nHappy new year.']"
"'\n[Operator instructions I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Igor Khislavsky, vice president of investor relations.', '\nIgor Khislavsky -- Vice President, Investor Relations\nGood morning and thank you for joining American Towers fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 earnings conference call.', '\nAnd finally, Rod Smith, our executive vice president, CFO, and treasurer, will discuss our 2020 results and 2021 outlook.', '\nDuring the quarter, our property revenue increased 10% to $2.', '\nThe decrease included the impacts of approximately $181 million in impairment charges in the quarter across several markets, as well as the non-recurrence of certain income tax benefits in India from 2019.', ""\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."", '\nThese results were supported by attractive organic tenant billings growth rates which averaged 6% in the U.', '\nConcurrently, we grew our annual common stock dividend by more than 150% from $1.', '\nBut over the longer term, we expect it to create tremendous value for our stockholders while helping to secure a significant share of industry-leasing activity in our sites and supporting the deployment of 5G across the country.', '\nHowever, most of the accretion in shareholder value will be realized over time as we generate lease-up, construct additional sites to round out the portfolio, and drive higher margins.', '\nThis was particularly relevant this past year as we enhanced our commitments to diversities throughout the company, committed funds to help counter social injustice and structural inequities, and sought additional opportunities to make a positive impact including initiatives to help bridge the digital divide through programs like our digital villages.', '\nMoving to Slide 7, you can see that the U.', '\norganic tenant billings growth rates of around 2% across the next two years.', '\nAs part of that growth, we expect our gross new business commencements to accelerate beyond 2020 levels given the deployment of new technology, new spectrum, and new market entrants.', '\nSaid another way, the majority of our expected baseline future organic growth in the United States through 2027 is contractually guaranteed today.', '\nwill be slightly higher than current levels through 2027 as 5G deployments take hold and as new spectrum like C-Band is deployed.', '\norganic growth I just referenced to to be an important component of our AFFO trajectory.', '\nFurthermore, we expect recent and future M&A, together with our accelerating newbuild program to drive additional value.', '\nAs in the past, we expect M&A to be a key piece of our future growth story.', '\nFinally, we continue to believe that our leading investment-grade balance sheet is a key differentiator for the company and expect that it will be an important component in achieving double-digit consolidated AFFO per share growth.', '\nWe have tremendous visibility into our future baseline growth trajectory, including having roughly $59 billion in contractually committed revenues supported by long-term, mutually beneficial, comprehensive master lease agreements with key tenants.', '\nOur mission-critical tower portfolio, ability to execute across our global footprint, disciplined, reliable, and proven approach to capital allocation and strong balance sheet all position us to achieve the long-term predictable growth that Tom referenced earlier.', '\nOur fourth-quarter consolidated property revenue of $2.', '\nAs expected, U.', '\nFinally, we translated that strong adjusted EBITDA growth to solid consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share growth of nearly 9% or about 12% on a currency-neutral basis.', '\nChurn was just under 3% and there was a negative 10-basis-point impact from other items.', '\nWith respect to organic tenant billings growth, volume growth from collocations and amendments contributed 3.', '\nOther run-rate items added 20 basis points while churn, concentrated in India, was just over 5%.', '\nThis increase was primarily driven by strong underlying revenue growth, net straight-line benefits, and continuing cost efficiencies throughout the business.', '\nWe also grew consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share by nearly 8% in 2020 as a result of our previously discussed growth in cash adjusted EBITDA.', '\nOn a currency-neutral basis, these strategic efforts and effective management of our cost structure facilitated consolidated AFFO per share growth of roughly 11.', '\nand in our international markets, we expect gross new business additions to our recurring monthly run rate to be above 2020 levels.', '\nSecond, we expect churn to be somewhat elevated this year due to a combination of T-Mobile lease cancellations in the U.', '\nOf the roughly $375 million in total annualized legacy Sprint churn that we expect over the next four years, more than 50% or just under $200 million will hit our run rate in 2021, with the vast majority churning off October 1.', '\nWe continue to work closely with the Indian wireless carriers as they plan for the future and are optimistic that churn rates in India will continue to trend down over the next several years.', '\nTaking these assumptions into account, as you can see on Slide 13, we expect consolidated property revenue to grow by nearly 8% at the midpoint of our outlook, supported by solid overall levels of organic new business and contributions from new assets.', '\nAnd on a consolidated basis, our outlook assumes more than $23 million of gross new business monthly run rate added across our tower, and debt assets in 2021, up about 20% as compared to 2020.', '\nOn a gross basis, we expect monthly new business run rate added in 2021 to exceed what we added in 2020 by more than 15%.', ""\nI would note that these projections don't include significant contributions from Dish, nor do they assume material C-Band deployments until quite late in the year."", '\nMoving on to Latin America, we expect organic tenant billings growth of around 7% for the year, broadly in line with what we saw in 2020.', '\nOn the inorganic side, we expect to further accelerate our newbuild program and anticipate constructing around 600 sites, a year-over-year increase of almost 50%.', '\nPartially offsetting this are escalators that we anticipate will be around 70 basis points lower than last year and churn of about 3%, up about 140 basis points versus 2020.', '\nIn Europe, we expect organic tenant billings growth of over 3% in 2021, up from 2.', '\nFinally, in India, we expect organic tenant billings growth to be roughly flat in 2021, broadly similar to what we saw in 2020.', '\nAs a result, although we expect churn to be 11%, down from nearly 14% in 2020, overall organic tenant billings growth is projected to be similar.', '\nWhat is less clear is the specific timing of that growth acceleration, which will depend on a number of factors in the marketplace.', '\nThis includes continued high margin flow-through of organic growth, as well as the impacts of accretive M&A transactions completed in 2020, along with built-to-suit activity and a full year of our recent MLA agreement with T-Mobile.', '\nMoving to the next slide, we expect to convert our adjusted EBITDA growth into year-over-year growth and consolidated AFFO of around $322 million or 8.', ""\nMoving on to Slide 17, let's review our capital deployment in 2020 and our expectations for 2021."", '\nIncluded in our discretionary capex spend is the expected construction of 6,500 new sites worldwide, an increase of more than 600 sites compared to 2020.', '\nIncluding this transaction, we expect that roughly 90% of our total capital deployment in 2021 will be in investment-grade-rated geographies with investment-grade carriers.', '\nNow, turning to Slide 18, I will discuss our financing plans for the pending Telxius acquisition.', '\nOn the debt funding front, we expect to utilize a combination of our recently upsized revolving credit facilities and new euro-denominated term loans and plan to opportunistically consider long-term sources, including senior unsecured notes.', '\nAs always, through this process, we remain disciplined and focused on minimizing dilution to our common stockholders while optimizing our long-term value creation objectives.', '\nIn the U.', '\nBrett Feldman -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nYes, thank you for taking the question, and -- and just a few about the outlook you provided for domestic organic tenant billings growth.', '\nAnd then just on churn, I think you suggested a non-Sprint churn was going to be in the 2% range this year, which is a bit above trend.', '\nSo with regards to our U.', ""\nSo we'll see churn beginning in the fourth quarter, that'll represent about $200 million of annualized run rate that'll begin to come off or come off in Q -- in Q4 of 2020."", '\nSo everyone knows there was kind of a slowdown in -- from T-Mobile and Sprint in 2020, began in 2019, and -- and went into 2020.', '\nAnd then the final piece is this, the size of our base is getting bigger and that usually brings down growth by about 20 bps.', '\nBrett Feldman -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nOK.', ""\nBrett Feldman -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nAnd -- and it's correct --\nRod Smith -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer\nAnd gross new business is accelerating as we head into 2021, and we expect that to continue into 2022."", ""\nTom Bartlett -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nAnd actually, Brett, I -- I -- I would just add, as -- as I've mentioned before, when we get through this churn, because -- and then we had this really locked in kind of growth rates with our key customers, we would expect the churn really to fall off quite a bit, significantly actually, and they kind of at the '23 to 20 -- '24 to '27 kind of timeframe, which is reflective in some of the growth rates that -- that I laid out for our long-term perspective."", '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins.', ""\nSo are there additional long-term deals that you've recently renewed or entered into with carriers other than T-Mobile that is contributing to that visibility into that long-term guidance?"", '\nSo that gives us I think some really good comfort in terms of what we would expect.', ""\nI'm compensated candidly on the bulk on -- on AFFO per share growth, as well as return on invested capital."", ""\nAnd then we -- we're -- we're working through what 2022 will look like, but clearly are committed to driving that double-digit AFFO per share growth over the -- the long period of -- of time as we've done in the past."", ""\nThere are potential for additional acquisitions, as well as integrating the acquisitions that we've already announced, particularly the InSite transaction and the Telxius to drive additional growth."", '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss.', ""\nRic Prentiss -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nFirst, appreciate all the details, short-term, long-term guidance, really helps set the table here as far as what we're looking at."", ""\nTom Bartlett -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nNo, hey, Ric, I mean I don't -- I don't -- I don't mean to be a wise guy."", ""\nI like to think it's also a function of the level of service that we're providing and -- and the quality assets that we have."", ""\nYou know, we're really excited about some of the organic growth that we expect to see in the region particularly in -- in Germany as they've just gotten through their 5G spectrums and as we see new entrants coming into the marketplace."", '\nTom Bartlett -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I clearly see it advancing in the United States first.', '\nYou know, we have a massive global platform, Ric, which I think is really going to be -- puts us in a really unique spot to be able to offer that global platform to hyperscalers, datacenter companies, even global MNOs who are looking for that kind of a ubiquitous tie -- type of a capability.', ""\nAnd I think that even in our own market in the United States in our portfolio, you know, there probably 4,000 to 5,000 sites that we've identified where we think that we can bring in several shelters into a -- into a site being able to offer up, you know, 20 to 30 cabs with a -- with a 100 to 300, 400 kilowatts of power."", '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery.', ""\nAnd then, Tom, maybe just come back to India if you could talk about pricing trends there and capital raising and the ability to maybe move past and return to more normal growth in '22 and beyond?"", '\nUnknown speaker\nBroadway is starting coming all --\nOperator\nJust a second.', ""\nThe balance will be spread across 2022, '23, and '24 and, I guess, in broad percentages that you can think about 16% of that total $375 million rolling off in 2022, an additional 13% coming off in 2023, and then another 19% coming off in 2024 and then that'll be the end of the Sprint churn."", '\nSimon Flannery -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nTom Bartlett -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nAnd then, you know, Simon, on India, you know, as Rod said and I alluded to as well, we continue to remain really positive on the market overall.', ""\nAnd -- and it's coming down on a year-over-year basis and we will -- it will continue to come down and that's what we need to be working on with our -- our carriers particularly Vodafone in the -- in the region."", ""\nAs I mentioned before and with -- with Ric, you know, we really see some nice growth, I think, that we're going to be experiencing there."", '\nI think the pandemic has made that even more obvious because, you know, so many Indians there are looking for telehealth services and they need that broadband connection.', ""\nWe're also seeing our -- our customers, in particular Vodafone, you know, looking to identify different areas to be able to infuse capital."", '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of David Barden.', '\nDavid Barden -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nHey, guys, thanks so much for taking the question.', ""\nSo, now it's at 6% And, I guess, the question then becomes -- two questions."", '\nTom Bartlett -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nOK.', ""\nBut as I talked about it, I mean, to be -- you're -- you're right we talked about kind of 6% to 8% kind of growth rate console -- on a consolidated basis."", ""\nI mean, it's largely from pure organic growth coming from our contractually committed master lease agreements that we have with our -- with our customers."", '\nAnd as I said that, you know, we do have a -- a big -- a much bigger base of business.', ""\nAnd you know, double-digit NOI, so it's a really good return of capital for us and with good tenants."", ""\nYou know, we're kind of being expected from my perspective in Germany and -- and, you know, I think."", ""\nWe did -- we do have a big Sprint churn event which will impact us over the next couple of years which is to no one's surprise kicking in really the fourth quarter here."", ""\nSo, it's kind of a long rambling answer for a question but -- but I think it's pretty consistent."", '\nDavid

"'\nOperator\nGood day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the PDF Solutions Inc.', ""\nJoe Diaz -- Lytham Partners LLC, Managing Partner\nThank you, Laurie, and thanks all of you for joining us on today's call."", ""\nSome of the statements made during the course of this conference call will be forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding PDF's future financial results and performance, growth rates and demand for its solutions."", ""\nWith that said, I'd like to introduce John Kibarian, PDF Solutions', President and Chief Executive Officer, who will be followed by Adnan Raza, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer."", '\nLet me now turn the call over to John Kibarian, President and CEO of PDF Solutions.', '\nAs we head into 2021, we have established the components enabling the next step in the evolution of PDF Solutions.', '\nToday, I will summarize the progress we made in Q4 and all of 2020, what our perspective of the environment is and our expectations for 2021.', '\nIn 2020, our business was primarily providing an analytics platform to a community of customers that enable them to optimize yields reliabilities and operations through the manufacturing life cycle.', '\nEntering the year, pre-COVID, we anticipate continued adoption of our solutions for leading-edge customers and measured growth in the adoption of our Big Data version of Exensio via the cloud.', '\nOur business on the leading edge for yield ramps characterization and DFI was lumpy and smaller than we anticipated for the year.', '\nIn Q4, the two largest deals in the quarter were again for Exensio via the cloud.', '\nExensio particularly via the cloud tended to have three to five-year contract durations or our characterization contracts tended to be shorter in duration.', ""\nThe combination is more than, additive, as our relationship with these companies is enhancing Exensio's value for our foundry fabless system and OSAT customers."", '\nAs Advantest and PDF have been meeting with customers the frequent feedback we get is that customers were happy Advantest was using an industry accepted platform to deliver their capability, rather than providing a proprietary solution.', '\nNow integrated with PDF we will continue this business model.', ""\nIn summary, Q4 and 2020 overall were transformative for PDF accelerating our cloud business as we move to be a platform for the industry's analytics and machine learning."", ""\nLike 2020 we anticipate continued demand for our analytics platform particularly on the cloud from a broad-based section of customers including equipment companies' fabs OSATS fabless system companies and Tier one auto suppliers."", ""\nThis is driving interest in PDF's products and services."", '\nIn 2021, we anticipate analytics revenue growth to be above that level in part due to our private bookings continued momentum and the addition of a full year of Cimetrix and Advantest.', ""\nAs we continue to deemphasize our IYR solutions our long-term model anticipates the company's total revenue growth rate approaching the target analytics growth rate of 20%."", '\nFinally, I want to thank all of the PDF employees and contractors for the efforts during what has been an exceptional year.', ""\nNow I'll turn the call over to Adnan, who

"'\nEileen McLaughlin -- Vice President, Investor Relations\nGood morning, and thank you for joining Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings 2021 first quarter earnings call.', ""\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that this conference call includes forward-looking statements."", '\nPlease note that our earnings release and the slide presentation are also available on our website and are integral to our earnings conference call.', '\nWe delivered consolidated revenue of $371 million, down 32% compared to the prior year, excluding China and FX.', '\nThese investments are primarily centered strengthening our ability to monetize our growing digital platform as well as our print assets and elevate our value proposition among the broader universe of advertisers.', '\nPut another way, we are broadening our discussions with clients beyond just the locations of our outdoor footprint to the value of specific audiences we reach with these assets.', '\nNow, let me provide a brief update on each of our business segments beginning with Americas.', '\nFurther, while our transit business is showing some improvement, it continues to lag in the recovery process, which is weighing on our performance.', '\nWith regard to our technology investments, we added 14 new digital billboards in the first quarter giving us a total of more than 1,400 digital billboards across the United States.', '\nOur innovative combined offering helps brands better understand out-of-home advertising impact on key metrics such as user engagement, website visits, and app downloads.', '\nTurning to our business in Europe, based on the information we have today, we expect second quarter segment revenues to be between $200 million and $220 million, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.', '\nMeanwhile, we are continuing to see promising signs in some of our other markets, particularly in the U.', '\nSo in summary, we remain committed to executing on our strategy to expand the revenue potential of our global portfolio and optimize our ability to take full advantage of the economic recovery.', ""\nBefore discussing our results, I want to remind everyone that during our GAAP results discussions, I'll also talk about results adjusted for foreign exchange, a non-GAAP measure."", '\nIn the first quarter, consolidated revenue decreased to 32.', ""\nPlease turn to Slide 5 for a review of Americas' first quarter results."", '\nEurope revenue of $150 million was down 29.', '\nSegment adjusted EBITDA was negative $62 [Phonetic million after adjusting for foreign exchange.', ""\nOn to

quarter of 2023, an estimate that total charges for the Europe portion of the international restructuring plan, including $10 million of charges already incurred will be in a range of approximately $51 million to $56 million.', '\nWe are optimistic about our prospects and may look to accelerate capex spending as appropriate to the balance of the year commensurate with the slope of the recovery.', '\nAs we elevate our ability to demonstrate the effectiveness of our assets in influencing consumer decision making and continuing to make our inventory easier to buy particularly among digital ad buyers, we will look to expand our revenue growth potential.', '\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nOperator Instructions Your first question comes from the line of Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo.', ""\nSo if you could maybe help put some color or context around those large urban revenue areas and what sort of trends you're seeing and maybe the same question for Europe."", ""\nWilliam Eccleshare -- Chief Executive Officer\nSo Steve, the question about theatricals is a good one and just to clarify, they do buy spectaculars but that's not the majority of what they buy."", ""\nWilliam Eccleshare -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, I mean I think it's a mixed bag across the country, but it definitely is, and certainly as we look Q2 and beyond, we're definitely seeing that."", '\nBrian Coleman -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nAnd Steve, I think you asked about Europe as well.', ""\nWhat is consistent is that week-by-week, lockdowns are being lifted and week-by-week, as those lockdowns are lifted, the revenue comes back and comes back pretty strongly, but it's going to be happening during the second quarter that, that recovery is taking place and so I think what I would say is if you average it out across Europe, April continued to be slow."", ""\nWilliam Eccleshare -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd Steve, I'll jump in and answer the covenant question quickly."", '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.', ""\nBrian Coleman -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nYeah, so I'll talk a little bit about the revenue guidance comment."", ""\nScott Wells -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes, the programmatic question, I'm happy to take the U."", ""\nIn terms of our plans, I think you will see us add at least one more SSP, which are sort of their supply side platforms, they're sort of the large-scale distribution platform that give you access to different DSPs, which are the demand side platforms."", '\nAs to the question on local, we have had a few local customers buy programmatically.', ""\nWilliam Eccleshare -- Chief Executive Officer\nNo, I'd only say I think I said right at the start of this year that the programmatic was going to be a key part of our agenda right across the company and what Scott's been doing in the U."", '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Lance Vitanza with Cowen.', '\nWilliam Eccleshare -- Chief Executive Officer\nIt really depends, Lance, on how much digital inventory we have in each market.', '\nSo I think in the U.', ""\nBrian Coleman -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nThat's correct and I actually think we disclose what the availability, which would be the size of the revolver less any kinds of commitments, which would include LCs."", '\nOperator\nYour next question is from Stephan Bisson with Wolfe Research.', '\nBrian Coleman -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nI can take a stab at that and then William and Scott, if you want to weigh in, respectively.', '\nThe other part of your question about, do we ever expect margins to hit pre-COVID levels.', '\nWilliam Eccleshare -- Chief Executive Officer\nScott, do you want to make any comment for the U.', ""\nScott Wells -- Chief Executive Officer\nI mean I think the only thing I'd just say is that the next several quarters are going to be lumpy and that could go in both directions and so what's driving that is, we're still in negotiations and still in approval processes on different relief programs and we will start to see some snap backs happen as relief that we got during the worst of the crisis played through and so it's probably not going to be a linear path over the next couple of quarters, but I think medium to long-term, you will see a healthy margin profile reemerge."", ""\nBrian Coleman -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nScott, I'm glad you mentioned that."", ""\nWilliam Eccleshare -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes, so I would only add, I was going to use the lumpy word as well, I'm afraid."", '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from David Joyce with Barclays.', '\nScott Wells -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure, so in the U.', '\nOn the other hand, advertisers might do all 4 of our RADAR products here in the U.', ""\nThey are absolutely a growth channel and we are definitely seeing advertisers, including out-of-home in their digital campaigns where they might be buying other digital advertising products along with digital out-of-home, the work space for these omnichannel DSP's includes click boxes where they can add digital out-of-home alongside display ads or search or other things like that, but that is still the minority of our programmatic revenue at this point, it's something that we think has huge promise, but it's an emerging channel."", '\nDavid Joyce -- Barclays -- Analyst\nYeah, those comments were all just for the U.', '\nScott Wells -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, that was all U.', '\nWilliam Eccleshare -- Chief Executive Officer\nIf you take Europe RADAR, we launched RADAR in just the U.', ""\nBrian Coleman -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nYeah, I don't think we know the answer to that."", '\nDavid Joyce -- Barclays -- Analyst\nAnd if I could just understand better the renegotiated site lease contracts.', ""\nBrian Coleman -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nWell, it's a mix and I think you start with when COVID impact was the greatest and you started with deferring payments on everything and trigger negotiations."", ""\nSo I think that once we once we confirm that's something is a permanent abatement, we disclose that and everything else is a deferral."", ""\nAs far as the question on the lag, I think when you go back and look at last year and now that we're disclosing the information you might see this a little bit more clearly on transit, we didn't see a precipitous fall off immediately and it's because a lot of the airport contracts are a little bit longer-term in orientation."", '\nAvi Steiner -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\nI appreciate that color.', ""\nBrian Coleman -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nYeah, that's one of the reasons why we kind of went out and gave a year-end liquidity position as I do think we have some swings particularly in the deferrals."", '\nRestructuring charges, yeah, look, I think we have a number of things going on.', '\nThat will take a little bit longer, but I do think, from a cash outflow perspective since a lot of that cost is really severance-related that they should be largely in line.', '\nThe lag varies market by market, dependent a bit on levels of digital inventory and a bit on specific circumstances, but as I say, Q2 is the key quarter for us as we turn that corner and look to the second half of the year to really demonstrate the business back into full growth.']"
"'\nOperator\nGreetings and welcome to the SKECHERS First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.', '\nUnidentified Speaker --\nThank you, everyone, for joining us on SKECHERS conference call today.', ""\nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to SKECHERS' Chief Operating Officer, David Weinberg; and Chief Financial Officer, John Vandemore."", '\nDavid Weinberg -- Chief Operating Officer\nGood morning and thank you for joining us today to the SKECHERS first quarter results.', '\nOur new quarterly sales record was a noteworthy accomplishment, given the shift of Easter into the second quarter this year, the negative impact of foreign exchange rate and the challenging domestic environment.', '\nNow turning to our business in detail.', '\nDomestic wholesale gross margins were flat while domestic retail margins increased 260 basis points due to improved pricing and a decrease in promotional activity.', '\nIn the first quarter, we opened eight stores and closed four.', ""\nTo support our domestic business, we ran several commercials in the first quarter including the launch of the new Tony Romo commercial during the Super Bowl, which received significant press coverage due to Tony's play-by-play during the broadcast."", '\nFor international, sales increased 9.', '\nOur International Distributor business had an extremely positive quarter with the strongest gains coming from Indonesia, the Middle East and Australia/New Zealand.', '\nTurning to international retail stores, at quarter end there were 2,586, an increase of 64 from year end.', '\nStores that opened included 35 in China, 9 in Malaysia, 7 in India, 5 in South Korea, 4 in Denmark, 3 each in Taiwan and Turkey, 2 each in Israel, Japan and Russia and 1 each in Azerbaijan, Brunei, Bulgaria, Finland, Guam, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Pakistan, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Switzerland and the UAE.', '\nAt quarter end, we had 284 international Company-owned stores.', '\nFor the remainder of 2019, we expect in excess of 400 SKECHERS branded stores to open, including approximately 30 to 35 Company-owned.', '\nWith more than 70 stores today, we believe this market can support significant additional growth over the coming years.', ""\nNow I'll turn the call over to John to review our financial and discuss our outlook."", '\nOur direct-to-consumer sales increased 6.', '\nGross profit was $590.', '\nGeneral and administrative expenses were up 1.', '\nThese expenses were partially offset by the receipt of a performance-based government rebate in China of $15.', '\nOur effective income tax rate for the quarter increased to 19.', '\nDuring the first quarter, we acquired approximately 458,000 shares of common stock at a cost of $15 million, representing an average price of $32.', ""\nBefore reviewing our balance sheet in detail, I'd like to note that on January 1st, 2019, we adopted the new lease accounting standard ASC 842."", '\nTrade accounts receivable at quarter end were $736.', '\nCapital expenditures for the first quarter were approximately $51 million, of which $10.', '\nFor the full year 2019, we expect our total capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million to $275 million.', '\nIt also reflects our confidence that the domestic wholesale business, while likely to be down mid single-digits in the second quarter, will be flat on a full year basis.', '\nThis guidance also takes into account the commencement of joint venture operations in Mexico as well as current exchange rates and does not anticipate a substantial change in the mix of our business in those currencies.', ""\nAnd now, I'll turn the call over to David for closing remarks."", '\nAdditionally, our international and direct-to-consumer businesses are on track for another year of strong growth.', '\nJay Sole -- UBS -- Analyst\nGreat.', ""\nSo all of that and all that conversation including the positive, like I said before, backlog lets us believe that we're going to continue and we will move forward."", '\nJay Sole -- UBS -- Analyst\nGot it, OK.', ""\nThat being said, as I point out fairly regularly, there's a portion of that SG&A that is definitely volume based and so as we see volumes change, there will be an impact there, mix can play a role, in particular, in overseas markets where we're relying on third-party distributors today, in particular, in that e-com channel, so that can have a play."", '\nJay Sole -- UBS -- Analyst\nGot it.', ""\nJohn Vandemore -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes, in terms of the gross margin percentage, it was, you know, wasn't that sizable between 10 basis points and 20 basis points."", '\nJay Sole -- UBS -- Analyst\nGot it.', '\nJeff Van Sinderen -- B.', '\nDavid Weinberg -- Chief Operating Officer\nWell for the second part, I absolutely believe those bankruptcies and as retail gets cleaned up and there are less closing of stores and discounting of inventory will be to our benefit among multitude of price ranges that we compete in.', '\nJeff Van Sinderen -- B.', ""\nJohn Vandemore -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes, I think you'll see over the back half, well, then the last three quarters of the year are normalized levels."", '\nJeff Van Sinderen -- B.', '\nJohn Vandemore -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes, I mean, just to be clear, when we talked about domestic wholesale coming out of the fourth quarter, I think we were especially vigilant of the fact that Easter was shifting and that was a significant item.', ""\nTo David's point earlier though, what we see in our core customer base, again, is very positive indications of how the products are performing and then we couple that with the positive trends, we've seen in our own domestic direct-to-consumer channel, obviously, the consumer still is looking for our product and taking our products really I think more about the retail struggles that the market face broadly."", ""\nDavid Weinberg -- Chief Operating Officer\nYes, I think it's important to note also, that it's not only related to China."", ""\nNow what happens going forward is, we're looking at places where we could take advantage with price increases, as we've done in the past and you saw it basically in Europe and in Great Britain."", ""\nAnd we think at the end of the day, this year given the partial year, given the exchange of the royalty, it's probably a couple pennies of accretions, but again that's partly because of start-up, partly because we're getting used to removing the royalty stream and we expect again that to have a lot of growth opportunity ahead of it."", ""\nJohn Vandemore -- Chief Financial Officer\nLaurent, as Dave mentioned, and obviously, it gives rise also to minority interest because we're a 60% owner, that means there's going to be a 40% minority share to be taken out."", ""\nJohn Vandemore -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes, I don't know that we want to get into abundant detail by segment on SG&A, again because remember that there's a lot of shared costs in the domestic number that are benefiting the organization globally."", ""\nJohn Vandemore -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes, a couple dynamics there, first I'd note that you're going to continue to see FX as a headwind in Q2, so that doesn't abate."", ""\nSo we continue to see that it's important to meet our consumer wherever they want to be able to buy our product, which also gives us confidence that the investments we're making to replatform our site, add a lot of capability for digital marketing, are going to pay off handsomely once they come to fruition in the back half of the year."", '\nDavid Weinberg -- Chief Operating Officer\nYou should note also that the comp stores sales are held back some by our decisions last quarter at the back half of last year, not to promote so significantly and get the complete gross (ph) margins that we need.', '\nJohn Vandemore -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes, I mean, just to be clear, those were always accounted for in our numbers on a consolidated basis.', '\nJohn Vandemore -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes, actually we feel really good about the gross margins.', ""\nBut overall, we've seen strength in the gross margin."", ""\nChris Svezia -- Wedbush Securities -- Analyst\nI guess more pointedly John, just do you anticipate -- how should we think about -- sort of flattish as we go into Q2 and the balance of the year or are you anticipating any improvement and then on the back half, you've got a little bit more difficult comp on the DTC side, just how do we think when you sort of anniversary that, how does that apply to your thoughts?"", ""\nThe other thing I had mentioned to balance off certainly Q2 is, we'll continue to have FX pressures, that's not something we're going to -- we don't believe we can escape given the current exchange rates."", ""\nBOBS, figures to grow (ph) , our sport division, where D'Lites are and our chunky shoes continues to grow and there's some new entries there."", '\nJohn Vandemore -- Chief Financial Officer\nI would add to that, you know, the biggest evidentiary point we can give you is the backlog.', ""\nJohn Vandemore -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes, listen, I think -- I don't know that we can be very specific about particular trends in China other than noting that over the back half of last year and early part of this quarter, I think you definitely saw a noticeable softening in that market from a macro perspective."", ""\nDavid Weinberg -- Chief Operating Officer\nYes, I mean, I can definitely give you some color, but I'd just point out that it doesn't really matter to us if a consumer buys through e-commerce or in the stores."", ""\nSo what you'd kind of see is essentially kind of a flat store number and maybe down slightly depending on the reach of the market and then you'd see obviously a fantastic e-commerce growth number."", ""\nSam Poser -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst\nAnd then -- but we should expect that that should improve in second quarter, just at Easter, right, I mean, you can't really measure that impact but there's impact there, is that correct?"", ""\nSam Poser -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst\nAnd then, so I just want to make sure I got -- you've guided total international and then can you give us-could you break down -- domestic also you expect to be high single digits, international wholesale and total retail, how are you thinking about that, could you give some clarification?"", '\nJohn Vandemore -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes, probably the best way to think about it, Sam, is China continues to be -- and the Asian joint ventures continue to be the most significant driver of minority interest.', ""\nSam Poser -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst\nSo, I mean, it was up, you know, it's going to have (inaudible) is that a percent we should use how would -- ?"", ""\nSam Poser -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst\nI'll pop up (ph) later."", ""\nJohn Vandemore -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes, I mean, the margin structure for China is, you know, as we said, it's an accretive business for us from an operating margin standpoint."", ""\nIn broad brush strokes though, the opportunity for us is to get out of the piecemeal fulfillment costs that the vast majority of our units have to flow through simply because we're using a third-party distribution center."", ""\nJohn Vandemore -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, I think we've been pretty clear about where we think the margins can go to

"'\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Atabak Mokari, CFO.', '\nOur complete financial results will be available when we file our Form 10-Q with the SEC.', ""\nThese forward-looking statements are described in today's press release, and the risks and uncertainties that may affect them are described in the press release and in our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q."", '\nWe expect our revenue growth to continue and have reiterated our 2022 revenue guidance of $400 million to $430 million.', '\nPreviously, R&D expenses could be deducted from income for the purposes of calculating federal tax in the year in which they were incurred.', '\nI will now turn the call over to Charlie Robb, our chief business officer, to provide an update on our litigation with generic manufacturers, Teva and Hikma Pharmaceuticals.', ""\nIf the court rules in Teva's favor, we will proceed to trial, most probably sometime next year."", ""\nAll of our compounds modulate cortisol's effects by binding strongly to the glucocorticoid receptor, or GR."", ""\nOur Cushing's syndrome business has funded all of these programs and will continue to do so."", '\nWhile our study was not powered to show a difference in overall survival, or OS, compared to nab-paclitaxel monotherapy, women in the intermittent relacorilant group also live longer than those in the comparator arm, with a p-value that approached statistical significance.', '\nFirst, women who enroll in ROSELLA must have received prior bevacizumab therapy, which is the current standard of care in the United States for patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.', '\nMedian PFS for women who received relacorilant intermittently was 7.', '\nA second mechanism by which cortisol modulation may prove useful is by blocking an important tumor growth pathway.', '\nWhile the primary endpoint in both studies is reduction in body weight, it is important to stress that measures of metabolic activity will be examined that are equally important to patient health.', '\nWe look forward to results by year end.', '\nThe trial results were published in Frontiers in Endocrinology last year.', '\nWe and our investigators are eager to take GRACE to the finish line.', '\nWe have reiterated our 2022 revenue guidance of $400 million to $430 million.', '\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions And our first question comes from the line of Matt Kaplan with Ladenburg.', '\nMatt Kaplan -- Ladenburg Thalmann -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nSo about two years from now, we should see results from the ROSELLA trial.', '\nMatt Kaplan -- Ladenburg Thalmann -- Analyst\nOK.', ""\nAnd I hope to really be able to update you on how we're thinking about that in coming calls."", '\nOperator\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Dennis Ding with Jefferies.', '\nJoe Belanoff -- Chief Executive Officer\nOK.', '\nSean Maduck -- President, Endocrinology Division\nDennis, yes, thanks for the question.', '\nSo I would say those two are the main drivers of the change: new patients and new prescribers.', '\nJoe Belanoff -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd Charlie, would you like to answer the second question, please?', '\nOperator\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Michael Convente from Canaccord.', '\nSo for the phase three ROSELLA trial, can you remind us what led to choosing the nab-paclitaxel of the active chemotherapy control?', '\nBut after we got very positive and supportive comments from the FDA, we then looked at other analyses around prior bevacizumab use, as well as patients who had one to three prior lines of therapy and patients who had excluded -- where we excluded primary platinum-refractory patients.', '\nSo looking at those phase two results and talking and working with the FDA, we felt it was simplest to just repeat the phase two trial in our phase three study design.', '\nThey tend to have a median OS of around 18 to 32 months, which is quite a long time for a trial.', ""\nAnd I'll get back to you with more specifics in coming calls."", '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Greg Fraser from Truist.', '\nSean Maduck -- President, Endocrinology Division\nNo, we have not seen an impact from the competition.', ""\nWe've completed a few investigator meetings in the U."", '\nOperator\nAnd your next question comes from the line of RK from H.', '\nRK Ramakanth -- H.', '\nOn the ROSELLA study, do you -- does the study have an interim look?', '\nJoe Belanoff -- Chief Executive Officer\nBill, could you take that question?', ""\nAnd so, when we hit our pre-defined PFS numbers, that's when we will read out the study."", '\nRK Ramakanth -- H.', ""\nI said it before, ALS is kind of -- as much as we have on the Mount Everest of medical maladies, it's a terrible problem."", ""\nBut I do think that we will be enlarging our programs in this area, and hopefully ultimately be able to offer patients -- and we actually have preclinical investigators who are studying Huntington's disease at this point."", '\nBut I do think that we will be enlarging our programs in this area, and hopefully ultimately be able to offer patients something they clearly cannot get today.', '\nRK Ramakanth -- H.', ""\nAnd then in the GRATITUDE studies, where the data is expected by the end of this year, so what's -- what are the next steps in those development programs in terms of when you could initiate this year?"", ""\nBut I just thank our internal staff and our investigators for actually getting this all enrolled and up to the point where we're going to see results."", ""\nNow, the answer to your specific question, I could give you -- my general answer would be it's going to be results dependent as to sort of what we have to do next."", '\nRK Ramakanth -- H.', '\nOperator\nAnd your last question comes from the line of Alan Leong with BioWatch News.', '\nAlan Leong -- BioWatch News -- Analyst\nCongratulations on another good quarter.', '\nJoe Belanoff -- Chief Executive Officer\nAlan, I really apologize.', '\nAlan Leong -- BioWatch News -- Analyst\nOK.', ""\nAnd just -- I'll just fill in, one, that you have a good memory."", '\nAlan Leong -- BioWatch News -- Analyst\nAnd lastly, this question might be for Sean.', '\nJoe Belanoff -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, that is a good question for Sean, Alan.', ""\nThat's where we spend obviously a lot of our time educating physicians, and through that, we've seen some demand increase."", ""\nAnd that's the group that actually GRADIENT study focuses on."", '\nOperator\nOperator signoff\nDuration: 0 minutes\nCall participants:\nAtabak Mokari -- Chief Financial Officer\nCharlie Robb -- Chief

"'\nOperator\nGood afternoon, and welcome to the Bloom Energy fourth-quarter 2019 earnings call.', '\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with U.', '\nKR\xa0and Randy will review the operating and financial highlights of the quarter, and then we will take questions.', '\nThe restatement is solely driven by an accounting adjustment for the capital equipment and installed portion of our managed services agreements, less than 10% of the total revenue over the effective period.', '\nWe report our sales backlog once a year.', '\nThey are asking, what do I need to do to keep my lights on securely?', '\nTraditionally, in the past years, the percentage of the total business that was microgrids was in the low teens.', '\nManufacturing industries have become very sensitive to the price of not having power.', '\nAnd now I will turn over to Randy.', '\nRandy Furr -- Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, KR.', '\nSo with that said, I will now summarize the accounting changes.', '\nThe upfront cash proceeds that we receive from our financing partners, the banks, will be offset with a liability in the form of a loan on our balance sheet.', '\nWhile making these adjustments, we also identified and made some additional minor adjustments for stock-based compensation and derivatives expenses.', '\nLike many other companies, we are required to adopt the new standard with our new fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.', '\nIn order to provide greater clarity on both the impact of the accounting changes, as well as the adoption of ASC 606, we have provided you with accounting change reconciliation schedules to take our GAAP reported numbers and reconcile those for the impact of the ASC 606 adoption, as well as the impact of the accounting change restatement, and we adjust for the noncash stock-based compensation to get you to the adjusted financial metrics.', '\nAdjusted EPS was $0.', '\nSo summing up, all the current contract backlog and future contracted revenue yields approximately $4.', '\nI will add more color on this in my ASP discussion.', '\nTotal installed system cost or TISC come in at $4,289 per kilowatt, a number within, and on the positive side, or put another way, below the midpoint of our estimated range.', '\nTypically, our international business does not include installation.', '\nOur operating income in Q4 was $21.', '\nThe focus of our efforts has been on refinancing the approximately $289 million of the 6% convertible notes that are due in December of this year.', '\nGiven the strength of our business and the positive momentum we have, we remain confident that we will work through this in the first half of the year and that our refinancing approach will be in the best interest of our equity and debt holders, as well as our partners in the business.', '\nWe are simplifying our estimates to two metrics as part of our outlook, one for the top line and one for the bottom line or total revenue and adjusted EBITDA.', '\nPeriodically, we may also provide visibility into other metrics, but they have a meaningful impact on the quarter.', '\nIn fact, many of the Q4 orders will represent 2021 revenue.', '\nThey look to Bloom to keep their business operating.', '\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions And your first question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.', ""\nSo in the immediate term, what we see is normal business is going to be affected, whether it's people being able to come to work, whether supply chain is getting disrupted."", '\nIf you look AT&T or customers like that that need to keep the communication links running, if you look at somebody like Kaiser Permanente wanting the hospitals running.', '\nLonger term, we really believe in a very connected centralized world.', ""\nBut I'm more than happy to take this further if you want to."", ""\nThat's what we are focused on for the long term when we look at carbon capture."", '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.', '\nMichael Weinstein -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nCould you talk a little bit more about the upfront margin, which dropped, I guess, 44% quarter over quarter to $1,617?', '\nAnd the other is our product and install cost, the combination of those, which we refer to as TISC, total installed product cost.', ""\nFrom quarter to quarter, we're going to have a richer mix, meaning just the mix of business in there."", '\nAnd you are seeing that flow through in Q1 and a bit more in Q2.', '\nMichael Weinstein -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nKR Sridhar -- Principal Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer\nMichael, and then I think you asked a question on the long term, and here is the way to think about it, right?', '\nOperator\nOperator instructions Your next question comes from Paul Coster with J.', '\nPaul Coster -- J.', '\nI mean, it seems to me that you could easily run rate your production forward and grow from that, so it has to be something to do with the lead time on installations.', ""\ncommercial and industrial, we're also, for lack of a better term, a construction company, and we go out and we install these systems."", '\nOperator\nYour last question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.', '\nPavel Molchanov -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nThanks for taking the question.', '\nC&I orders come from the utility companies.', '\nDoes that answer your question?', '\nOperator\nOperator signoff\nDuration: 65 minutes\nCall participants:\nMark Mesler -- Vice President of Finance

"""\nOperator\nHello and welcome to today's Unum Group fourth-quarter 2022 earnings results and conference call."", ""\nA presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures included in today's presentation can be found in our statistical supplement on our website in the investors section."", '\nExcluding these items, after-tax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of 2022 was 286.', '\nAfter-tax operating earnings were $287 million in the fourth quarter and a record $1.', '\nPersistency of our in-force business was healthy across all products.', ""\nWe are also encouraged to see colonial life's growth with 6% sales growth in 2022 as they get back to high single-digit growth rates."", '\nCombined ROE for the core businesses was 17% for the full-year 2022, up from 10% in 2021.', '\nFor long-term care, we have been very pleased with the continuation of our interest rate hedging program, which we began earlier in 2022 and continue to build upon.', '\nSteve will provide additional details of recent activity on both the hedging program and premium rate increase approvals in just a moment.', '\nRisk-based capital for our U.', '\nTo summarize, our purpose-driven, profitable, industry-leading employee benefits business is building momentum as we come out of 2022.', '\nAs expected, strong group disability loss trends continued in the fourth quarter with the group disability loss ratio remaining in the mid-60s, a trend we expect to continue into 2023.', '\nAs Rick mentioned, we ended the year with an after-tax adjusted operating EPS growth rate of 42.', '\nFor the full year, our effective tax rate was 19.', '\nI expect to return to focusing on year-over-year\xa0results for business line performance with our first-quarter 2023 results, given the continued endemic progression of the COVID-19 pandemic.', '\nThis was driven primarily by lower earnings in the supplemental and voluntary lines despite very strong levels of operating income from the group disability line.', '\nWe are very pleased with how this block is performing and, given improved incidence trends, expect the group disability benefit ratio will continue in the mid-60% range in 2023, given our stable staffing levels and supportive return-to-work environment.', '\nWe estimate that COVID-related impacts were close to our expectation of approximately $10 million per quarter.', '\nResults for the dental and vision line were slightly above third-quarter results as the benefit ratio decreased to 65.', '\nGrowth in premium income in the fourth quarter was 4% on a year-over-year\xa0basis, adjusted for the change in estimate within the individual disability unearned premium reserve with particularly strong performance in the group disability business.', '\nPersistency continued to remain generally stable, with only minor variation by line of business, with our total group block at 89.', '\nAs has happened in the past few quarters, the high levels of inflation experienced in the UK distorted the reported benefit ratio this quarter.', ""\nFor the first quarter of 2023, we're expecting a muted inflationary impact in Unum UK."", '\nBoth businesses continued to generate positive levels of annual year-over-year\xa0sales growth, with Unum UK up 43.', ""\nThis quarter's result trended slightly downward with premium income 0."", '\nIn the closed block segment, adjusted operating income, excluding the amortization of cost of reinsurance related to the closed block individual disability reinsurance transaction, was $40.', '\nThe level of performance for LTC this quarter is consistent with our long-term expectations of an interest adjusted loss ratio between 85% to 90%, while our rolling 12-month ratio remains below the range due to pandemic-related claimant mortality in early 2022.', '\nWe expect to continue expanding the hedging program over the coming quarters.', '\nDespite this volatility, income from our portfolio remained positive, posting $11.', '\nWhile lower bond calls pressure net investment income in the short term, maintaining higher-yielding securities is beneficial to our portfolio yields in the long run.', '\nFurther, we experienced net upgrades of over $500 million in the fourth quarter and estimate net neutral rating actions in 2023 within our portfolio.', '\nOur capital metrics have benefited from the rebound we saw in our statutory earnings this year.', '\nCapital contributions into the Fairwind subsidiary were $50 million in the fourth quarter, which brings the total for the year to $515 million, which is below our original expectations of $550 million to $600 million coming into the year.', ""\nWhile we will discuss in more detail at the meeting, I'll provide two reminders about LDTI's impact to Unum."", '\nAt that meeting, we will dive deeper into a discussion of our business strategy, what our updated capital plans look like for the year, and provide additional outlook for the entire exciting year ahead.', ""\nAnd probably the first thing I'll do is just step back and just talk about our expectations for rate increase programs."", ""\nAnd we really haven't seen that change with the change in interest rate."", '\nI think you highlight an important part of our franchise and our group disability line, and so, we saw very good results over the course of the year.', ""\nSo, that gives us a little bit of confidence that, you know, that's a good point estimate for us going forward on new claims coming in."", ""\nIt's a healthy book of business."", '\nAnd is this just protecting NII in the event that rates decline in the future?', ""\nWe want to reduce uncertainty with the new money yields that we're able to get in the future, specifically around long-term care."", '\nOne of the things that we want to do as part of Investor Day is really quantify that a little bit more for the market to really show what the impact of that is under different scenarios, different interest rate paths.', ""\nSteve Zabel -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, you know, I would say that's something that we're just planning on expanding over time, not trying to set a bright-line target."", '\nSo, we think sort of aggregate pricing levels in the market as being pretty rational and, you know, in line with sort of how we would have an outlook on the major costs that make up the prices that we set.', '\nJimmy Bhullar -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nAnd when you think about the talk, certainly, of recession and what that looks like to our overall premium growth, we have benefited over the last -- certainly, over the last 12 months, last 18 months from an increasing amount of -- in the labor markets from both wages, as well as from good employment.', '\nTom Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGood morning.', '\nSo, I just attribute it to normal volatility.', ""\nKnow we do ultimately think that that loss ratio would be down more in the low 70s, but it'll take probably a bit longer to do that."", '\nTom Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGot you.', '\nDid you say you expected it to revert back to £20 in Q1, or would you expect that inflation benefit to last a bit longer into early 2023?', '\nRick McKenney -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, I appreciate that question.', '\nIn the UK, the inflation benchmark, we used to speak to 14.', '\nAnd we think our long-term position with this business should be generating something in the low 20 millions.', '\nTom Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGot you.', ""\nMark Till -- Head, International Business\nYeah, in the early part of '23 as it starts its trend down from what's now 13 and a bit toward a more long-term average."", '\nTom Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGot you.', '\nYou only got 100 million of NPV of rate increases in 2022, which then makes your January success of 200 million for one state.', ""\nTom Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nI'm sorry."", '\nBut what I would say is that they are getting through the process.', '\nTom Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nDid you give a specific number for that in the fourth quarter?', '\nPretty evenly split, Mark, in terms of new employees coming on, as well as the wage increases that are coming through.', ""\nRick McKenney -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI think it's important, Mark, to realize that, as Mike mentioned, that is the group lines."", '\nSteve Zabel -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, I would say the normal run rate for that business is anywhere between 45% and 50% benefit ratio.', '\nMark Hughes -- Truist Securities -- Analyst\nThen, the sales within within Colonial by accident, sickness, disability, the core product this quarter down a point, a little bit softer than what we saw earlier in the year, anything to that?', '\nWe still see very strong interest in voluntary benefits products from employers.', ""\nIt's when you think about '23, would you -- do you view the full-year expense ratio for '22 as a reasonable starting point, or do you think more about the more elevated level in the fourth quarter?"", ""\nWe are very excited about what that's going to mean for our small business clients and what it's going to mean for growth."", ""\nAnd that's the last thing I'd say, Ryan, is as you think about those investments in technology and as we have success with those in market, they have a dual benefit."", '\nAnd so, like Steve said, as these take hold and more and more of our transactional volumes are coming digitally and through self-serve, we would expect that OE ratio to start coming down in the second half of next year.', ""\nSteve Zabel -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, that's probably a -- you know, a decent marker, Ryan."", ""\nYou know, I think it's tremendous to see the $1 billion statutory earnings."", ""\nWe're going to continue to put it back behind our business."", '\nWe will expect to do -- continue to do that.', '\nMike Simonds -- Chief Operating Officer\nYeah, thanks for the question.', '\nSo, again, our Total Leave platform, we set some pretty big goals for this year as our first year in a national rollout phase, and we significantly exceeded those goals.', ""\nAnd, you know, as we look forward and we think about kind of a moderate recessionary scenario of GDP down low single digits and we run that through our portfolio, we feel really good about the fact that we don't see any, you know, material impairments within the portfolio."", ""\nSo, just curious if that's something that you guys -- or who you agree with, A."", '\nAnd I guess where I start is you do see a linkage when you think about disability.', '\nThe second is where that impact gets felt.', '\nSteve Zabel -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, I would say we we did increase -- I forget what the percent was, but we did increase that over the past year when we saw rates go up.'"

that we identify clients' mission-critical priorities, and we help them with those mission-critical priorities."", ""\nAnd it's just as important to the HR leaders."", '\nAnd some of the Q2 performance or overperformance was driven by revenue being modestly better than expected.', ""\nAnd so the way to think about the balance of the year is, as an example, in Q2, we weren't immediately backfilling open roles even in certain research or service positions."", '\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from Bank of America.', '\nBut I think one might argue, given that a lot of investors are looking at this as sort of a throwaway year that if there were opportunities to bring that back this year, even if you were to have margins below that target, but that improved the pace of recovery into next year that, that might be a wise decision.', '\nEugene A.', ""\nSo we're basically bringing back that capacity so that we're very well positioned, especially beginning in 2021, to reaccelerate growth."", ""\nThat doesn't hurt our future growth or anything like that."", ""\nCraig Safian -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nAnd Gary, I

that point, if we continue at current course and speed with sort of this sort of retention result and this sort of new business phasing or pacing, I should say, that the contract value growth would stabilize.', ""\nBut again, I think the thing that as we look at the business, and it is tough out there, but our teams are doing a really fantastic job of sort of cutting through the tougher selling

about 1/3 of the difference if you look at CV growth; and then the other 2/3 from existing clients not growing that would have grown before or from clients that are still with us, same number of

reemphasize the point that periods of volatility cannot be periods of dormancy in terms of our fundamental activity every single day, which is working to develop relationships will ultimately turn into deal flow.', '\nSo I guess maybe your implicit question, does Encore Boston create a slip stream, not only for the highest end regional properties, which we will be the market leader in owning, but will it also create upstream for other regional assets?', '\nBut we talked about realty income here a lot going into gaming.', '\nDaniel Adam -- Loop Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOK, great.', ""\nAnd I would say that our strategy going forward, having done the transformative deals we've done, Venetian to a degree, but especially MGP is that having achieved the scale we've achieved, having in place some of the built-in growth elements that we do have, we really want to begin to develop more of a flow model."", '\nAnd we realized that that sheer amount of equity, $5.', '\nMichael Bilerman -- Citi -- Analyst\nYeah, and I think taking a step further, it still feels as though there is some level of overhang on the shares.', ""\nAnd so that's where I was trying to get at is where your heads at now in terms of eliminating this overhang that appears to be on your shares."", '\nWe will be raising only debt.', ""\nAnd it will be our bias to not have to raise our grants to an amount of equity because we're very conscious of the fact that we need to give our shareholders, understood broadly a chance to realize that revaluation that they deserve, and it will be easier to achieve if we do not go out into the market and raise a little town of equity, to use the technical term."", ""\nMichael Bilerman -- Citi -- Analyst\nSo are you having those discussions today in terms of joint ventures or selling incremental land parcels or assets outright to put yourself in a funding position so that when a pitch comes down, you've already been funded, getting to this point where

well, you get to kind of a run rate of roughly $2 billion of AFFO.', ""\nSo if you lever that two to one, that's $1 billion of buying power that we have internally to continue to deliver the growth that we've delivered since day 1."", '\nSo given that delta in just, for example, weighted average lease terms, things that are really important to us like the magnitude of rent escalation, like the magnitude of capex, maybe more important to us than to Sumit where Wynn will represent, I think -- Encore will represent 3% of his rent rule.', ""\nMichael Bilerman -- Citi -- Analyst\nYeah, and that's what I was just trying to get about."", ""\nEd Pitoniak -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, obviously one right now that's very, very critical is some measure of CPI protection."", '\nBut it

stickier getting back to norm on the operating margin side, largely because of our inability to leverage, retail G&A and even to a degree the distributor flow through that would normally leverage, our

progress we've made on our transformation and growth strategy, I'll provide some highlights about our performance."", '\nAnd based on what we know today, we see the results coming in at the higher end of the $10 billion to $11 billion EBIT adjusted range that we shared earlier this year.', ""\nBut I'm sharing it with you now as another example of how we are working urgently to achieve key milestones."", ""\nAnd we're already on the road to delivering a 60% cost reduction compared to the Bolt EV, with the next generation of Ultium, and we expect costs will continue to decrease from there."", ""\nAnd this is just the beginning, and we'll continue to expand our battery cell capacity on our way to achieving our goal of EV market share leadership in North America."", '\nThe Cadillac team unveiled the stunning LYRIQ production model, which we accelerated by nine months.', '\nThe initial interest has been overwhelming, especially from commercial and government customers.', '\nWhat makes our large-scale deployment of Super Cruise and all of its new features possible is our Vehicle Intelligence Platform, or VIP, which connects every vehicle system into one advanced, high-speed,

exactly what all the ins and outs are going to be for the rest of the year, I think it would -- that'd be data that has a pretty short shelf life."", ""\nRod Lache -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nCould you at least maybe give us some color on the magnitude of the volume loss that you're currently embedding in this full-year forecast?"", ""\nWhat's the strategy longer term for that region?"",

Citi.', ""\nYou certainly mean that we're operating much, much lower than what I think -- we even think is optimal."", '\nSo that visibility, I think, undoubtedly will help us over the long term.', '\nBut you know, we certainly hope to build as we get into perhaps late 2021 into 2022 to start getting inventory levels that what we think is a much safer value to have vehicles on the lots where customers want to purchase them.', ""\nSo you take that and, you know, I've always said we have kind of a revolutionary and an evolutionary strategy around driver assistance all the way to full Level 4, Level 5 autonomy."", '\nSo both paths are very important because the technology we put on vehicles today, I think, makes them safer and delights the customers and is going to give us an opportunity for subscription revenue.', '\nOperator\nThe next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.', ""\nSo there's obviously some offsets in raw materials and costs and pricing."", '\nPaul Jacobson -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, thanks, Emmanuel, for that question.', ""\nSo for example, you know, things like the used car vehicle prices that GM Financial is clearly benefiting from, you know, that's likely to stay in place as long as new car inventories remain low."", ""\nThe reality is where we and others are right in the middle of this, I think, we're doing a really good job of managing through it as evidenced by the first quarter and the fact that the first half of the year is coming in above consensus estimates before we announced."", '\nEmmanuel Rosner -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOK.', ""\nPaul Jacobson -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, you know, clearly, on the second part of that question first, you're going to continue to see engineering expenses pivoting in the EVs."", '\nMary Barra -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, you know, I think we see it as a huge opportunity.', ""\nSo I think we're going to see strong demand there, it will -- along with some other products be an important part of getting to our goal to have North America leadership."", '\nEmmanuel Rosner -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.', ""\nI mean, would you argue that record profits indicate that you're in an optimal inventory?"", ""\nMary Barra -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nSo, John, I think you're right that we'll never go back to that levels of inventories that we held post or pre-pandemic because we've learned we can be much more efficient getting the right models to the right dealers and leveraging and not having as much on the lot."", ""\nYou know, I've got them sending me pictures that they have virtually nothing on the lot."", ""\nBut I think there's an optimal level that's a little higher than we have right now."", ""\nJohn Murphy -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nI just think you're being sort of too apologetic."", ""\nMary Barra --

Lynch -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nHow do you keep track like the capital invested the returns in the profits on all these new growth initiatives?', '\nBut I mean, how are you keeping track of all this stuff?', '\nMary Barra -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, we have a really good CFO.', ""\nSo I'm -- rest assured that this is not PowerPoint, these are real initiatives that are being executed in an accelerated fashion."", '\nPaul Jacobson -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd, John, for the record, I agree with everything Mary said except this claim on the CFO.', '\nJohn Murphy -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nThe -- on Dubai, I mean, there are other cities that have like city envy here that, you know, Dubai is obviously a great sort of crown jewel, you know.', ""\nMary

got."", '\nPaul Jacobson -- Chief Financial Officer\nSo, thanks for that question, Joe.', '\nSo, you know, what I would say is that we are carefully evaluating the short-term supply chain, the intermediate-term supply chain, and some of the longer-term issues as well.', ""\nSo, I wouldn't say that Q1 was immune from the semiconductor challenges."", ""\nSo, there isn't a -- there isn't necessarily a read-through in the short term because, you know, something that happens in March versus something that happens in April isn't really all that relevant to how we're thinking about managing through this."", '\nJoseph Spak -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nYeah, no doubt.', ""\nPaul Jacobson -- Chief Financial Officer\nNo, I don't necessarily think that's the case."", '\nJoseph Spak -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nJoseph Spak -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThank you very much.', '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan

couple of things when you said for every ED adoption, there's a D adoption."", ""\nBody shop structures or machinery and equipment, a paint shop, which is a 30 to 35-year asset, doesn't care if it's painting what the propulsion system is in the vehicle that we're going to be painting."", ""\nBut look at what's in the marketplace right now, I think we're really one of the only people that have an all-electric vehicle that is as affordable as the Bolt EV."", ""\nSo, I think we're moving at a very quick speed to be able to provide EVs for everyone."", '\nAnd maybe where that was a year ago, so we can get some sense of the, you know, the attach rate and the growth penetration year on year.', ""\nAnd that's why I think having the ability to do it in a subscription model as opposed to having to make the decision, you know, on Day, 1 I think, is going to be very, very important."", '\nOperator\nOur last question comes in the line of Ryan Brinkman with J.', '\nRyan Brinkman -- J.', ""\nSo, I think the best thing to do is get you into a vehicle so you can experience it because it's quite effective."", '\nRyan Brinkman -- J.', ""\nSo, I'm excited to share that story as we come out, and I

"'\nBryan will start us off with some commentary on our second quarter operations and recent trends.', ""\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bryan."", '\nOur comparable portfolio achieved a second quarter average daily rate of $295, a 14% increase as compared with 2019.', '\nIncluding these two hotels, our total portfolio generated a second quarter RevPAR of $237 made up of a $320 ADR at 74% occupancy.', '\nThe primary driver of the higher out-of-room spend in the quarter was increased banquet contribution from the group activity at our hotels.', '\nTurning to costs, while the property teams have been successful in reducing certain operating expenses and achieving permanent cost savings, our operators have not been immune from the labor and other cost pressures that have been impacting our industry.', '\nIf we exclude the two hotels in our portfolio with significant renovation activity in the quarter, our pro forma comparable hotel EBITDA margin was a very strong 36.', '\nThis group room night volume represents a 66% increase from the prior quarter, with average rates that were 7% higher than the same quarter in 2019.', '\nOur recent trends reflect increasing lead volumes and strength in short-term booking activity with a higher contribution from corporate group events.', '\nOur second quarter occupancy at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco more than doubled year over year, with rates higher by nearly 40%.', '\nWhile leisure has led all segments, we expect increasing amounts of corporate and group travel to become a larger portion of demand as we head into the fall and that traditional seasonal patterns will increasingly reemerge.', '\nAs travel demand normalizes, we would anticipate the cadence of our quarterly profitability to also more closely resemble historical patterns with some adjustments needed for the current composition of our portfolio.', '\nFollowing the sale of three noncore hotels in the first quarter, we redeployed those proceeds plus additional capital in the second quarter into the purchase of the Confidante Miami Beach and the remaining 25% interest in the Hilton San Diego Bayfront.', '\nWe expect that our well-located urban and group-oriented assets will see continued growth in the coming quarters as demand for business travel and corporate events continues to catch up with the already robust leisure demand at our resort properties.', '\nThere is significant potential to enhance the property and transform its earnings potential.', '\nWhile we will experience some displacement during the third and fourth quarters of 2022, these projects should provide meaningful growth next year, especially during the first quarter of 2023 when these large group hotels will be comping off of the Omicron impact from earlier this year.', '\nWe continue to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector and retain additional capacity that we can use to grow per share earnings and NAV in the coming quarters.', '\nAs Bryan mentioned earlier, we are seeing indications that travel patterns are normalizing, which should result in the return of a more traditional seasonality into our quarterly earnings cadence.', '\nHistorically, our third quarter contributes more to our full year earnings than the fourth quarter.', '\nGiven the impressive rates garnered by Montage Healdsburg and Four Seasons Napa, these two assets are expected to add approximately $25 to the total portfolio of ADR for 2022.', '\nWe ask that you please limit yourself to one question.', '\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions Our first question will come from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays.', ""\nMost of those bookings point to something that we've seen throughout this year is that bookings tend to be -- even for larger group business tend to be shorter term."", ""\nWe talked about last quarter, larger corporate events that we're booking in the quarter for the quarter, and that's just sort of the environment that we've seen."", '\nOperator\nYour next question will come from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.', '\nDuane Pfennigwerth -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nHey.', '\nBryan Giglia -- Chief Executive Officer\nOK.', ""\nWe're now on a run rate basis roughly 44% group, 25% business transient and 31% leisure, much healthier mix than what we were going into the pandemic."", '\nNow that we brought some balance back to the portfolio, that growth can come from urban assets that growth can come from resort assets and because the future sales will be opportunistic, they could come from either of those assets, too.', ""\nTo your specific question in San Francisco, San Francisco is -- we believe it's still a fantastic long-term market."", '\nOperator\nYour next question will come from the line of Chris Darling with Green Street.', ""\nChris Darling -- Green Street Advisors -- Analyst\nBryan, I'm hoping to get your views on how the transaction market has evolved over the past three or four months."", '\nFor hotel owners, especially private hotel owners, the CMBS market is that is the primary funding mechanism for hotel transactions.', ""\nI still -- I think we'll see transactions get done."", '\nBut until the market and the debt market really get its legs back.', ""\nI do think, as Bryan pointed out, the challenges in the debt markets will definitely slow down transactions, especially larger transactions as they're just harder to finance."", '\nOperator\nOur next question will come from the line of Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities.', '\nPatrick Scholes -- Truist Securities -- Analyst\nWith Europe opening back up again, have you seen any pressure on demand for some of the resorts, what I would call, hot resorts that did exceptionally well over the last year or two, namely in Florida or Western resorts.', '\nAnd as we look out to the rest of the year and as summer comes to an end over the next couple of weeks as schools start seems earlier and earlier every year.', ""\nThose hotels, as they open and Montage remember opened before the Four Seasons, we're starting to see good group business get layered on, which then will allow us, especially during the high season during the crush will allow us to compress rates."", '\nOperator\nOur next question will come from the line of David Katz with Jefferies.', ""\nBryan Giglia -- Chief Executive Officer\nSo with the credit facility, one, again, as Aaron said, we're in a time period where capital gets a little tighter, we want to thank our bank partners for not only going through the process and extending our existing debt, but actually allowing us to expand and expand the term loan debt."", '\nBut if we do find something today and there is dislocation, we now have a fully undrawn line where we can go ahead and deploy without having to add on additional debt capacity or recycle other assets to acquire.', ""\nAnd so that's why we thought it was very important to not only find a more permanent or longer-term placement for that line draw, but more importantly, to replenish the line to be able to go and deploy that into future opportunities."", '\nOperator\nOur next question will come from the line of Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank.', ""\nBut going forward, as we add a little bit more occupancy back and rates, I don't want to call it top, but if one were to call a top on rate growth, do you think you can still get margin expansion or are we in a situation where inflation is kind of catching up and now you're adding more, more variable expense at a time when rates are potentially getting close to a peak?"", ""\nOur view and what we said on margins all along is we expect to achieve 100 to 200 basis points of improvement compared to '19."", '\nAnd then I think in the long run, it will also be determined by a couple of those larger fixed costs that sometimes you have less control over the real estate taxes, with real estate taxes have actually been pretty decent this year.', '\nOperator\nOur next question will come from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James.', '\nBryan Giglia -- Chief Executive Officer\nOK.', ""\nSo there were a few -- our expectations for the rest of the year is that, that's going to normalize back to 1 million to 1."", ""\nWe've seen fantastic growth as we get into -- as we got in the second quarter, the year-over-year growth still far from '19, but it's been very strong."", '\nChris Ostapovicz -- Chief Operating Officer\nSan Francisco, certainly in Q2, as Bryan mentioned, has it performed much better than what we had thought going in, especially on the rate side.', '\nAnd we continue to see better rate traction than what we even expected from the second quarter but going into the third and fourth quarter.', '\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi.', '\nBryan Giglia -- Chief Executive Officer\nOK, good morning, Smeeds.', '\nAnd then so from that standpoint, our dividend policy that we had in the past would be to pay the base dividend for quarters 1 through 3 and then quarter 4 have a true-up dividend.', ""\nSo that's good current cash flow."", '\nOperator\nOur final question will come from the line of Michael Bellisario with Baird.', '\nMichael Bellisario -- Robert W.', '\nBryan Giglia -- Chief Executive Officer\nOK.', ""\nIt will obviously have contribute less cash flow in the short-term once it's renovated by let's just say whatever was in place today."", ""\nSo a little of that is pro forma-ing in the Confidante, but I think that, that's a fair way to look at it because it represents the current earnings power of the portfolio."", ""\nBryan Giglia -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, and then to your question of where the cracks -- what's going to crack first, if there will be cracks."", '\nSo when U.', '\nOperator\nI will now turn the call back over to Bryan Giglia

rental channel; hiring expectations and expectations regarding our sales and marketing roles and related investments; product development expectations; expectations regarding reimbursement and regulatory changes, including competitive bidding; or expectations regarding the market for our products, the impact of the COVID-19 public health emergency or PHE on our business and demand for our products in both the short-term and long-term and our ESG program.', '\nDuring the call, we will also present certain financial information on a non-GAAP basis.', ""\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Inogen's President and CEO, Scott Wilkinson."", '\nAs previously discussed, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact worldwide and on our Company in 2020 and has continued to have a meaningful effect on our business throughout the third quarter of this year due to a substantial reduction in patient travel and activity outside of the home as well as reduced consumer confidence.', '\nWhile these factors made for a challenging third quarter for our business, we saw total revenue and revenue for both domestic and international business-to-business channels grow sequentially from the second quarter of 2020.', '\nBefore discussing our financial results in more detail, I wanted to briefly give an update on the recently released Medicare traditional fee-for-service market data for the full year 2019 and Competitive Bidding Round 2021.', '\nBased on the dataset, we estimate that the share of portable oxygen concentrators in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare long-term oxygen therapy market grew from 13.', '\nIn regards to Competitive Bidding Round 2021, on October 27, CMS announced that competitive bidding contracts that were scheduled to go into effect on January 1, 2021 will not be awarded for most product categories, including oxygen, due to the payment amounts not achieving the expected savings and the current COVID-19 public health emergency.', '\nCMS also issued a proposed rule to establish payment amounts going forward through DMEPOS products and services covered under Medicare.', '\nCMS is proposing to set Medicare rates after the PHE at the 50/50 blended rates in the non-contagious and rural areas as a permanent construct, but Medicare rates in all other areas would be set at the adjusted payment amount.', '\nWith that, I will now provide details around our third quarter 2020 revenue by channel.', '\nDomestic business-to-business sales in the third quarter of 2020 decreased 23.', '\nInternational business-to-business sales in the third quarter of 2020 decreased by 21.', '\nDirect-to-consumer sales decreased 22.', '\nRental revenue in the third quarter of 2020 increased to $7.', '\nAs I mentioned in our second quarter earnings release, I have decided to retire from the Company by the end of 2021, and as a result, the Board of Directors has initiated a process for finding a new Chief Executive Officer for Inogen.', '\nWe believe we are a leader in POC technology with our product offerings and that the market for our technology remains underpenetrated.', '\nLastly, given where Inogen stands today and in spite of the challenges we and the global economy have been facing, we believe our strong cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $220.', '\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Ali Bauerlein.', '\nDuring my prepared remarks, I will review our third quarter of 2020 financial performance.', '\nTurning to gross margin.', '\nAs for operating expense, total operating expense decreased to $35 million in the third quarter of 2020 versus $35.', '\nGeneral and administrative expense increased to $8.', '\nIn the third quarter of 2020, we generated an operating loss of $2 million, adjusted EBITDA of $4.', '\nWhile we expect the COVID-19 pandemic and any potential for further prolonged lockdowns would have a negative impact on our sales in those periods, we also believe it is prudent to make investments to broaden our product portfolio with the use of the recently acquired New Aera technology and also build the necessary infrastructure to support our increased focus on rental.', '\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions Our first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.', '\nMillie -- J.', '\nNow, in the third quarter, we did see a little bit of stabilization.', ""\nNow, as we look ahead in the fourth quarter, we've already got some signals that things could tighten up."", ""\nNow, you've also got to, I'll say, put in the pop, that the fourth quarter is usually in normal times just seasonally a slower time."", '\nMillie -- J.', '\nScott Wilkinson -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director\nYeah, we actually started a limited launch at the very end of 2019 and then at the beginning of this year, and things progressed nicely in the limited launch.', ""\nBut I would also like to remind everyone that the real exciting part of New Aera isn't the product in its current configuration."", '\nMillie -- J.', '\nDanielle Joy Antalffy -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\nHi.', ""\nThe tough part about rentals, though, in the short term as far as its impact on the P&L is, you've got to recognize that the rental revenue recognition is over time and not upfront like a cash sale, whether that be B2B our retail sale."", ""\nWhile I don't want to make predictions about where will -- where the numbers land, because it's hard to predict mix over time, I will say that when we did execute our IPO back in 2014, rental revenue was about 40% of our total revenue then."", '\nDanielle Joy Antalffy -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\nGot it.', ""\nNormally, with that resolution in the third quarter, you'd start to see those get fulfilled in the fourth quarter."", '\nOperator\nOperator Instructions Our next question comes from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc.', ""\nIf I went back to the second quarter, I would say that's probably less than 20%."", ""\nAlison Bauerlein -- Founder, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Finance\nYeah, I'll take that one."", ""\nSo certainly, as we've seen with the COVID-19 PHE, the willingness to pay has been reduced from consumers for a cash option."", ""\nSo, with our shift to rental, if somebody qualifies for rental services, they're more likely to choose a rental as a lower-cost option than purchasing for cash."", ""\nAlison Bauerlein -- Founder, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Finance\nYeah, that's -- I'll take that one."", ""\nScott Wilkinson -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director\nIt's a good question, Mike."", ""\nWhat we're really focused on, though, is driving patient and physician awareness of POCs and if rentals is the right access point doing that ourselves or through our partners to get that adoption rate up."", ""\nScott Wilkinson -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director\nYeah, I think over the long term, Margaret, things don't change."", '\nNow, I would say that clearly, these patients need oxygen.', ""\nAnd looking at the domestic B2B channel, obviously, they still have the continued challenges they've had for years, restructuring their business and moving locations and trucks and drivers."", '\nIn Europe, most of the focus is with the large gas companies and large accounts over

that IDC recently published six reports covering areas of business spend management and Coupa was once again the leader in every one of them.', '\nSo let me close where I began, this year presented more challenges for all of us than we could have possibly imagined, but there is nothing more human than resiliency in the face of adversity.', ""\nDuring the year, we continued to invest across our organization and to the success of our customers and we made strategic investments with the acquisitions of Kinaxis, BELLIN, Much-Net, and LLamasoft during fiscal '21 and our most recent acquisition of Pana in early February."", '\nIn fact, even with the economic headwinds and the impact from our acquisitions, we executed well and still generated an adjusted free cash flow margin of 21%, up from 14% last year and we exited the year from a Rule of 40 perspective at 60% and we define the Rule of 40 as revenue growth rate plus adjusted free cash flow margin.', '\nCalculated billings for Q4 were $270 million, up 49% year-over-year and $642 million for the full year, up 37% compared to last year.', '\nTurning to gross margin.', '\nSpecifically, we delivered Q4 non-GAAP operating income of $11

significant contributions in both areas, but the most interesting I think and relevant for you as you think about our business in coming quarters and years is that is coming through a realization by the prospect that an integrated platform that supports all the use cases that we have now integrated together and put on to one technology platform, one usability layer, more and more one business logic layer is what they are actually looking for.', '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Chris Merwin from Goldman Sachs.', '\nChris Merwin -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nOkay, thanks very much for taking my question.', '\nCertainly, the addition of supply chain design and planning is a continued contributor to that and the willingness for just about any executive in the world that runs a meaningful organization to spend money on best-in-class modern AI supported information technology solutions for sorting out how to optimize their supply chain is very, very strong and so we will continue to charge fairly for the value as a service we deliver and continue to grow that value as a service on both ends as we continue to work our way into this market.', '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Brent Bracelin from Piper Sandler.', '\nRob Bernshteyn -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure, thank you for the question.', ""\nAnd so making that transactional construct part of our overall expense management offering and thus part of our overall business spend management offering just seemed like a complete no-brainer to us and we're well under way to integrating that offering already and we look forward to have being in market with that as one integrated suite here very, very shortly."", '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Brian Peterson from Raymond James.', ""\nRob Bernshteyn -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, to your first question on how we'd rank it."", ""\nSo we don't really think of it that way, but what I could tell you is that over the course of the last 12 or so years, we've progressed in terms of the sizes of some of the acquisitions we've taken on, but we did that very thoughtfully, very, very carefully, making sure that we do everything possible to increase the likelihood of those acquisitions being highly successful from a people perspective, from a process perspective, certainly from a technology perspective, as long as all of it is aligned with our common vision around business spend management and LLamasoft was certainly no exception."", ""\nTodd Ford -- Chief Financial Officer\nFrom a guidance perspective, Brian, we made an assertive Phonetic assumption that we're going to convert all the license to the cloud and the vast majority of the professional services work to GSIs which will bring them billions of revenues, if we're successful and we structured it in a manner such that if we don't succeed to the level we expect, our actual revenues and billings would be higher."", '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Peter Levine from Evercore.', ""\nRob Bernshteyn -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure, well we don't breakout pipeline in terms of add-on or net new, but I can tell you, it's certainly healthy in both and our primary focus is certainly on net new customers because the add-on business tends to come on, as I mentioned earlier, at a much lower cost of customer acquisition, happens much more organically."", '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Matt VanVliet from BTIG.', '\nMatt VanVliet -- BTIG -- Analyst\nYeah, hi guys thanks for taking the question.', ""\nRob Bernshteyn -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, on the first part around product, we feel like we're in a really good spot and our expense management module and offering on its own is used by hundreds of customers around the world and is very robust and it has been replacing a number of incumbent providers for some time with the travel booking component with Travel Saver as well, we're very encouraged of our ability to not only be competitive, but to really reframe the whole market."", '\nAlso, of course, using AI to track fraud.', ""\nTodd Ford -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd from a guidance perspective, really what we're doing with Pana is coming from a perspective of resiliency and skating to the puck, right?"", '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Josh Beck from KeyBanc.', '\nJosh Beck -- KeyBanc -- Analyst\nThanks for taking the question.', ""\nRob Bernshteyn -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I would say, what we're seeing is a probably what may be most valuable to the audience here is that there is a broader arc perhaps than just a one-year, if we look at five to 10-year arc, in that arc, there is no question whatsoever that this area of business spend management is making its way higher and higher on the priority list of digital transformation and moving to the cloud."", '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho.', '\nSiti Panigrahi -- Mizuho -- Analyst\nThanks for taking my question.', '\nOperator\nOur last question comes from Mark Murphy from J.', '\nMatt Coss -- J.', ""\nRob Bernshteyn -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, it's hard to predict, but I do think if I were to predict, I would say some of that is certainly sustainable for the longer-term."", ""\nTodd Ford -- Chief Financial Officer\nI just wanted to get some additional comments on the record because we've gotten some messages offline with respect to Q4 billings and revenue contribution inorganic and organic."", '\nIn addition LLamasoft had a strong Q4 from net new

Terry Tillman with Truist.', '\nSteven Beauchamp -- Chief Executive Officer\nWe certainly -- when you look at through the last year, we certainly saw some differences in places which shut down.',

from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies.', ""\nSteven Beauchamp -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes, it's a good question."", '\nBut in that segment, we absolutely hired people with the idea that you

"'\nThese non-GAAP financial measures may be different than the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.', ""\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the call over the Joth."", '\nIn the third quarter, we opened a record number of shops, 38, grew our revenue by more than 50%, and expanded our shop-level contribution margins both year over year and quarter over quarter.', ""\nWhile I am proud of these headline numbers, I'm equally proud of our new shops' quality."", ""\nAs we mentioned in last quarter's remarks, traffic trends began to stabilize in July and which continued into August."", '\nEffective pricing during the quarter itself was closer to 9.', '\nIn Q3, company operated shop contribution grew 62% year-over-year to $44.', '\nRecall that at the beginning of our public company journey, we shared five key objectives; continue to attract and develop people on growth capital, open new shops wherever people want great beverages with an eye 4,000 plus shop in the next 10 to 15 years, increase brand awareness and encourage deeper customer engagement, invest in and use technology to improve the customer experience and expand consolidated margins through operating leverage.', '\nThis was not entirely unexpected as turnover is often higher when we enter new markets and have to staff from scratch and start building our internal employee brand.', '\nWe are committed to growing our field organization organically, working in partnership with our franchisees to identify and promote outstanding crew members, and providing realistic growth ladder from being a broista to an operator with multi-unit responsibilities.', '\nSince 2017, we have developed a strategy successfully in several markets, including Tucson in Las Vegas, resulting in significant brand awareness and market share gains, improved customer experiences, and increased operational efficiencies.', '\nWhile we have seen cost escalations and several inputs, including site work and skilled labor, we remain focused on the long game and are encouraged by the resilience of our strong cash-on-cash returns, which remain in the range of 30% to 40% for ground leases.', '\nIn Q3, Soft Top was added to 16% of our drinks, up from 10% last year.', '\nKeeping the long-term interests of our customers remains a guiding light for us, allowing us to better manage periods of uncertainty.', '\nAs a 30-year-old company, we have the good fortune of our operating teams executing through many economic cycles.', ""\nWe've achieved four successive quarters of strong revenue growth, three of which were 50% or greater."", ""\nWe're executing our sales transfer fortressing strategy, delivering on our commitments to infill underpenetrated existing markets, rapidly expand new markets and evenly space demand for the convenience our customers deserve, and new shop AUV performance remained strong."", '\nNew shops are ramping toward cash flow efficiency, in line with our expectations.', ""\nSee page 10 of the supplemental earning slides posted on our investor relations website with this release, where our classes of '20 and '21 are delivering gross margins of 24% inclusive of 5%

1.', '\nSara Senatore -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nAnd then I did want to just ask about the -- to your point, you know, California continues to see a drag, but you saw some more normalization across dayparts.', '\nSo just trying to understand kind of the complexion of the top-line growth.', '\nJoth Ricci -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nOK.', '\nWe saw strong growth in our Freeze and Rebel business.', ""\nAnother element of growth that we didn't touch on is that 38 of the 39 markets that we track grew in Q3."", ""\nAs it relates to comps and things of that nature, I think that we're opening up a lot of trade zones and we're opening up a lot of new shops that may also contribute to some sales transfer that we're seeing in the market."", '\nSo I guess, what did you mean by sequentially when you talked about traffic?', ""\nCharlie Jemley -- Chief Financial Officer\nSo sequentially, from quarter two to quarter three, now we have seasonality in there

Baird -- Analyst\nSo is that adjusted for seasonality, or I mean, I guess -- or if you think about the year-over-year change or however you typically think about it.', ""\nCharlie Jemley -- Chief Financial Officer\nSo seasonality wouldn't be a year-over-year effect, to your point."", '\nDavid Tarantino -- Baird -- Analyst\nAnd then I guess I just wanted to understand how you are thinking about the fourth quarter, because the full year guidance implies a pretty decent range of outcomes, but I guess taken literally it would imply a step back to negative comps in the fourth quarter.', '\nDavid Tarantino -- Baird -- Analyst\nAnd then Joth, I was interested in hearing more about the one-to-one marketing that you mentioned.', ""\nThe other thing I want to speak on just quickly related to Charlie's comments is that Q4 last year was really that last run of COVID challenges, I think that we saw in the marketplace."", ""\nCharlie Jemley -- Chief Financial Officer\nIt's the highest two-year stack we face."", '\nJohn Ivankoe -- J.', '\nCertainly, I think about this as speed of consistency, certainly it fits with some of the environmental goals that you have.', '\nJohn Ivankoe -- J.', '\nJoth Ricci -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I think, the feedback has been tremendous.', ""\nSo cases of cold brew, cases of Rebel, cases of even our sparkling water business, and we'll continue to reduce the finished good line and we'll do more of a concentrate business as we get to the back half of the year."", '\nJohn Ivankoe -- J.', '\nSecond question on turnover.', '\nThe reason why the trailing 12-month number is higher is actually more driven by the phenomenon of the first quarter and the second quarter, which were higher than the first quarter and second quarter of 2021.', '\nThe tipping question is a great one.', '\nAnd I hope that everybody in every job does amazing work so they get a great tip.', '\nJohn Ivankoe -- J.', '\nSo can you give some context for the third quarter comp around the impact of California, and if California was a driving force to the positive?', '\nIn the second quarter, that market was down 9.', '\nNicole Miller Regan -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nSo really is traffic then, traffic and price.', '\nCharlie Jemley -- Chief Financial Officer\nMix is a drag, slight drag, probably some trade down going on there, which is logical.', '\nNicole Miller Regan -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nAnd then 4Q like was asked earlier, so for the whole year being flat and you kind of said, if I have this down negative comp.', '\nNicole Miller Regan -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nAnd then a real question -- and then just put me on mute, but a real question, the roasting facility.', '\nBut is that just the price increase determined based on your needs to hold margins at a certain level?', '\nCharlie Jemley -- Chief Financial Officer\nOur overall year-over-year cost of goods basket inflation in the third quarter was just shy of 11%.', '\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair.', ""\nIs there anything else that went into that metric because there's really good leverage, particularly for the comps you put up in the quarter?"", '\nCharlie Jemley -- Chief Financial Officer\nOn the labor side, the team has done a really good job of making sure that we forecast sales as accurately as we can.', '\nSo we just got better at our craft in the third quarter because the environment was less disruptive.', '\nJoth Ricci -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nAnd Sharon, if you look at the markets for next year, a couple of pieces of color on that.', '\nAnd then also, Joth, does the company have a higher level of promotional activity during the third quarter than maybe it did last year?', ""\nI can tell you that our discount rate in promo has stayed pretty even all year in the way that we've managed it, and we've kind of managed our -- how we drive promotions kind of specifically within that discount percentage and not doing any sort of large promotions that can -- honestly, it can really trip us up operationally if we're not careful."", '\nWe tested a product with Tajin on it in the third quarter that did very well and got great feedback not just from our consumers, but also from our stands and our baristas.', ""\nAnd so I think what we'll continue to do is try to showcase those beverages to our customers, especially in our new markets that are still learning how to shop, interact and have the Dutch Bros experience."", '\nJoth Ricci -- President and

this quarter already mentioned, we also recognized assets impairment in the amount of BRL395 million, representing the difference between the book value and the value announced in the transaction.', '\nThe other operating results line showed a BRL52 million increase over the second quarter of 2020 mainly due to tax credits, net of write-offs of BRL97 million in the second quarter of 2021,

progress of the main initiatives that we have to increase our competitiveness and profitability as we have been talking and as I presented in the Ultra Day in May.', ""\nThis is very, very relevant for us since it is really the biggest change in Ipiranga's operating model in many, many years."", '\nWrapping up in the ending line which we had presented at Ultra Day, we have a firm commitment to defend our current market share, especially in the Brazilian Phonetic network and business-to-business main customers.', '\nSo I now conclude my presentation in this first part of our meeting.', '\nAndre Hachem -- Itau -- Analyst\nThank you for taking my question.', '\nConsumer sales were very much pressured.', '\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Gabriel Barra from Citibank.', '\nGabriel Barra -- Citibank -- Analyst\nFred, Rodrigo, Marcelo, thank you for taking my question.', '\nNow, with regard to direct sales of ethanol, this is something we have never been against.', ""\nOur LNG operation is something that we're trying to reshape and try to operate on that side of the industry as well."", '\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Luiz Carvalho from the UBS Bank.', '\nLuiz Carvalho -- UBS Bank -- Analyst\nHello, Fred, Rodrigo, Marcelo.', ""\nTalking about obviously the position of the company in terms of challenges for the competition and even looking at your last slide, I'm very struck by how late you were in a few steps."", '\nMy second question has to do I think with the previous question with regard to refining.', '\nBut I think the strategy, the path is very clear for us.', '\nIn the second quarter of this year, we went back a little bit because of the regulatory issue, but we have already rebounded from that.', '\nNow we have a clear plan, and we have initiatives that will need time to mature obviously.', '\nBut if volumes remain flat for the next few quarters, and if we manage to sustain our market shares and recover volumes or sales volumes, we believe that we will be able to remain on track to gradually recover over the next few months.', ""\nAnd I'm sure that you've seen our presentation in Ultra Day that we've made a substantial adjustment in our organization."", '\nLuiz Carvalho -- UBS Bank -- Analyst\nYes.', '\nNow, with regard to your other question, we have our committees in place and the structure that was created about two or three years ago with these committees, makes it a lot easier for everyone to do their jobs.', '\nLuiz Carvalho -- UBS Bank -- Analyst\nThank you, guys.', '\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Vicente Falanga from Bradesco BBI.', '\nVicente Falanga -- Bradesco BBI -- Analyst\nGood afternoon, guys.', ""\nAnd my second question, we've been reading recently that the Polimix Group is building a terminal to export oil and handle byproducts in the State of Espirito Santo as well."", '\nSo our cycle during this quarter is one that started with the rise in ethanol prices, with good recovery and very substantial challenges in general, especially with ethanol and diesel.', '\nWhen the volumes grow, the demand is naturally greater and we see this -- the cost in the market settling as well.', ""\nSo it's a great challenging, even to be consistent to our other strategy, which is to strengthen not only our relationship with our network, but also to recover the financial robustness of that network, which had been very much pressured, because of the pandemic in the past year."", '\nVicente Falanga -- Bradesco BBI -- Analyst\nThat was perfect.', '\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Bruno Montanari from Morgan Stanley.', '\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Regis Cardoso from Credit Suisse.', ""\nAnd being a little more clear in what I mean in terms of margin

control.', '\nFurther, we continued our strong organic generation of new client relationships, and our loans outside of PP loans increased 5% over the same period last year.', '\nBanner has provided SBA payroll protection funds totaling more than $1.', '\nNon-performing assets remain low at 19.', '\nAnd I will note that this loan growth was not the result of loosening underwriting standards.', '\nCommercial loans, excluding PPP, grew by nearly 9% or 94 million in the quarter, which is an annualized rate of 35% and balances are now 5% higher than reported as of June 2021.', '\nThese reductions were offset in part by an increase in small balanced CRE totals of 30 million, also the result of the successful small business campaign during the quarter.', '\nCommercial construction balances grew by 14 million or 8% in the quarter, and one to four family construction loans grew by 43 million or 7% in the quarter.', '\nWe do expect that the increasing mortgage rates will have an impact on the velocity of home sales within our residential system portfolio, although we have not seen that materialize today.', '\nAs anticipated, agricultural loans reflect the seasonal drag on line of credit, with balances up 38 million quarter over quarter or 16% and are up 17.', '\nLastly, home equity lines again added materially to the loan growth in the quarter, up 36 million or 8% from the linked quarter.', ""\nStill, Banner's credit culture is one that is designed for success through our business cycles."", '\nCore non-interest expenses, which exclude Banner Forward, debt extinguishment, and M&A-related expenses increased 2.', '\nOne to four family real estate loans grew 150 million on the current quarter as a result of redirecting a portion of residential custom construction loans previously earmarked for sale or completion of portfolio with an increase in jumbo mortgage production.', '\nTime deposit balances declined 44 million from the prior quarter end, of which 8 million were due to the aforementioned branch sale and the remaining 36 million decline driven by higher cost CDs continuing to roll over at lower retention rates.', '\nTotal average interest-bearing cash and investment balances declined 275 million from the prior quarter while the average yield on the combined cash and investment balances increased 46 basis points due to a lower mix of overnight funds and higher yields on both the securities portfolio and overnight funds driven by higher rates -- higher market rates.', '\nThe ratio of core deposits to total deposits was 95% in the second quarter, the same as the previous quarter.', '\nExcess overnight cash is anticipated to decline at a more accelerated pace in coming quarters [Inaudible continued loan growth and deposit outflows.', '\nTotal deposit fees are flat while mortgage banking income declined 500,000 due to declining refinance activity and lower gain on sale spreads.', '\nExcluding Banner Forward, debt extinguishment, and M&A, core non-interest expense increased 2.', '\nIn closing, the company is benefiting from rising rates, as evidenced by significant margin expansion this quarter, stable, low cost deposit base, and strong diversified loan growth.', '\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\nOperator instructions We have the first question on the phone line from Andrew Liesch of Piper Sandler.',

growth in all of the business lines, whether it's business banking or moving upstream."", ""\nBut given the increasing economic uncertainty as we look into 2023, you can expect that we'll continue to be on the conservative side with regards to our level of reserves."", '\nJeff Rulis -- D.', ""\nIt's diversified across business lines, segments."", ""\nBecause Banner, we didn't match and didn't chase rates last -- in the last rate cycle and we never posted -- we didn't have any deposit campaigns in the interim period."", '\nWe tend to price in that 40th percentile of our peer group over time in terms of posted rates.', '\nJeff Rulis -- D.', '\nJeff Rulis -- D.', '\nAnd as these small business and resi mortgage campaigns continue on to the end of the month, balancing that with rate increases that impacted customers.', ""\nJill Rice -- Chief Credit Officer\nSo I'll start and then if Peter wants to chime in as well."", ""\nThey're located in markets with strong economic engine,

Rulis -- D.', '\nJeff Rulis -- D.', '\nTim Coffey -- Janney Montgomery Scott -- Analyst\nI had a question about Banner Forward.', '\nSo the whole notion is around the loan growth initiatives is to develop a sustained level of loan growth through the business lines to generate loan production over time.', ""\nAnd we'll begin to see those bear more fruit in the coming quarters as we get a full quarter benefit of those fee increase -- those fee programs and then some initial additional fee income initiatives that'll be coming online late this year and into the first half of '23 that will improve the core and core fee income line as well."", '\nTim Coffey -- Janney Montgomery Scott -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nPeter Conner -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, I think

Coffey -- Janney Montgomery Scott -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nTim Coffey -- Janney Montgomery Scott -- Analyst\nOK.', ""\nI wouldn't imagine there's quite a bit of that, but I was hoping you could maybe ringfence the amount of deposits you would be -- you consider more transaction would be willing to let go."", '\nLast time, there are there are small there is a small amount of balance that is rate sensitive that we expect to move our balance sheet as rates go higher.', ""\nA lot of it's operating accounts for businesses that really aren't there here for rates."", ""\nBut I'm not going to -- I can't give you a precise number, but I would anticipate some continuing reductions in our deposit balances due to rate as we go through the next several quarters."", '\nSo our guidance is more of a neutral, high 80s, a little 90s core expense run rate.', '\nSo we need to continue to retain capital to support loan growth.', '\nDuration: 0 minutes\nCall participants:\nMark Grescovich -- President

promotional period at that point.', '\nJohn Abbot -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, we I think last reported that at end of 2020 and it was 111% and at that point, we, I think, highlighted that it was likely bottoming out in Q4, Q1.', ""\nAnd I'm aware 1Q is a record quarter."", '\nHistorically, you might have said there was a little bit of within a quarter each month, it got a little higher and maybe over the course of year, it got a little higher.', '\nQ1 was really an exceptionally strong quarter adding 26 million FX adjusted and we feel like we essentially matched that remarkable level here in Q2.', '\nARR is obviously a leading indicator of revenue.', '\nBut we feel a good about the long-term increase in that number.', '\nJoe Gallo -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nOK.', ""\nSo I don't think there's much to pick on in there."", ""\nBut I described it in one of my answers, I think it was for Sanjit's question."", '\nAnd we removed price as a barrier.', ""\nSo there's certainly some, what I might call, private cloud, whether it's Rackspace, Equinix or even in the basement of the MSPs office where they're running Windows servers there."", '\nAnd we view that in the same way they do, helping to build SMB base within Azure and I think you will see us working quite closely together.', '\nSo it was a terrific quarter and we look forward to seeing you all on the next call.']"

quarter, along with the recent migration to a new call center technology.', ""\nI'm confident we've taken the right steps to put the customer experience and quality of enrollments at the center of what we do, and I believe we're establishing eHealth as the gold standard within the sector."", '\nOur online business continued to grow, with unassisted online applications increasing more than 50% year over year for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plan enrollments combined.', '\nAt the same time, our telephonic conversion rates, while showing a meaningful improvement compared to Q3, are behind our forecast.', '\nWhile our online business continues to generate strong growth, it is not yet large enough to offset the underperformance of our call center operations.', ""\nSimultaneously, I'm conducting a deeper review of eHealth's operations, financial performance, including cash flow simulations, current operating model, organizational structure, and strategic imperatives."", '\nI see opportunities to increase our sales effectiveness by dedicating our call center agents to more defined geographies so that they can be even more responsive to consumers and provide deeper insights into available plan options.', '\nIn my experience, this is critical to building loyalty and drawing consumers to our platform year round rather than just during the enrollment periods.', '\nMy focus goes well beyond maintaining strong enrollment and revenue growth.', '\nBefore I turn the call over to Christine to review the quarter and our financial results in more detail, I want to emphasize how excited I am to be leading eHealth.', '\nAnd now let me review our third quarter financial results.', '\nHowever, these quality initiatives did have a negative impact on our call center conversion rates in the third quarter.', ""\nWhile we don't disclose actual conversion rates for competitive reasons, I'd like to comment on the trend in this metric year to date."", '\nHowever, during the third quarter, our telephonic conversions declined over 30% compared to last year, reflecting the impact of enrollment quality initiatives that we implemented.', '\nThird quarter revenue from this segment was $17.', '\nThird quarter non-GAAP marketing spend was $41 million, up 30% year over year, reflecting lower enrollment volumes that were offset by higher marketing costs per approved member.', '\nOn Slide 10, you will see that cash collections on our MA cohorts enrolled in 2019 and earlier have now exceeded upfront acquisition costs and are cash positive.', '\nOur Medicare cash collections grew 37% year over year, outpacing our estimated membership growth.', '\nTotal revenue is now expected to be in the range of $535 million to $575 million, compared to the prior range of $660 million to $700 million.', '\nAdjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of negative $20 million to zero, compared to the prior range of $110 million to $125 million.',

asked an important question, and it's kind of, I think, a straight answer and a complicated answer that goes with it."", '\nThe combination of that then provides the opportunity to then convert those sales opportunities into sales.', '\nThe quality enrollment activities that we began implementing early second quarter into the third quarter have been where the challenge exists in terms of confirming that the beneficiary is in a plan that they desire.', '\nSo the learning curve is another challenge, which, I think, continues to improve every day.', ""\nBut that's a lot of change that's occurred in a short period of time, and I think that has put pressure on the results, which has -- and it's led to the shortfall."", ""\nAnd so there are challenges that are seeing -- sorry, the demand channels that are seeing challenges, but we're able to manage that much more dynamically than we could in the past and are doing so through Q3 and into AEP."", '\nGeorge Sutton -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst\nIf I could just ask one more thing.', '\nFran Soistman -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks for that question, George.', '\nThey need an organization, organizations like eHealth, to meet their needs.', ""\nSo our job is to get off the radar in that area in terms of the CTMs, and I'm quite confident we will do that."", '\nAnd in fact, I think organizations that are committed to continuous quality improvement have to then exceed wherever the benchmark was at the time.', ""\nBecause I think there is -- there's -- it's a very different kind of relationship dealing with a senior population."", '\nAnd we have to make sure that, as we are building our distribution for the future, that our sales agents reflect the composition of our society for Medicare eligibles as well, cultural requirements, language requirements, and do it exceptionally well.', ""\nAnd they've gone through a similar transformation -- some of them have gone through similar transformations before and seen exactly that behavior, where you end up actually converting better in the long run with a healthier book of business and better customer relationships."", ""\nFran Soistman -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I'm going to keep you in suspense a little longer."", '\nElizabeth Anderson -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nHi, guys.', ""\nSo I'll let Tim expand on that."", ""\nAnd so there's a little bit of that, that drives up cost in the quarter."", ""\nA little bit of it is a shift more toward online, where we have higher marketing costs, and that will probably continue to be something that we'll see going forward."", ""\nElizabeth Anderson -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nThat's super helpful."", '\nOperator\nActually, I left the queue.', '\nSteven Valiquette -- Barclays --

irrespective of what the nature of it is.', '\nFrank Morgan -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Daniel Grosslight with Citi.', '\nSo it has not played a role, in my judgment, in the AEP results.', '\nThere was an administrative sort of headache for our compliance teams to provide all of that information to CMS as rapidly as they needed to.', '\nTim Hannan -- Chief Revenue Officer\nDid you mean the sponsorship revenue?', ""\nDaniel Grosslight -- Citi -- Analyst\nAnd what's driving the decline in advertising revenue?"", '\nChristine Janofsky --

"'\nIn wireless we completed our first full quarter after the fundamental shift to implement plans with unlimited data.', '\nAs we work through this transition over the next several quarters, we believe our wireless business will be well positioned for the future.', '\nImportantly during this period of strategic transition, heavy investments, we delivered a long-term capital allocation program that strikes a healthy balance between maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing consistently in our core networks and 5G spectrum and returning sustainable on notable levels of capital to shareholders.', '\nAs I said last quarter, we made these changes after an thorough and thoughtful analysis on where the industry is going; what matters most to our customers.', '\nBy the second half of 2020, we expect to return to ARPU growth, reflecting a markedly faster transition than the unlimited experience south of the border.', '\nOur wireless network investment program to 5G ready LTE-advanced technology is paying off.', '\nLet me start by providing you with additional color on both the third quarter and on our unlimited plans.', '\nLooking forward, we expect our overage revenue to continue to decline over the next several quarters at rates similar to Q3 based on current uptake rates of these unlimited plans.', '\nWireless margins remain strong at 49%, an expansion of 180 basis points from last year.', '\nOur Q3 blended ARPU declined 2% this quarter, again largely as a result of the overage revenue decline I mentioned.', '\nTurning to Cable, we grew revenue by 1% this quarter and adjusted EBITDA up by 2%.', '\nAs reflected in these results, we continue to make good progress toward our stated goal of 20% to 22% capital -- Cable capital intensity and at least 25% cash margins by the end of 2021.', '\nMoving to Media, revenue was lower by 1% year-over-year, largely as a result of the sale of our publishing business in the second quarter and lower revenue from the Toronto Blue Jays.', '\nTurning to our consolidated results, we delivered stable revenue from a year ago and solid adjusted EBITDA growth of 6%.', '\nWe generated free cash flow of CAD767 million this quarter, an increase of 22%.', '\nOur debt leverage ratio at the end of Q3 was 2.', ""\nWith that, I'll ask the operator to open the lines for questions."", ""\nWhen we look inside that base, what do we see, we see a 50% reduction in the primary call drivers that we talked about, which is, bodes well for the future in terms of the cost reduction opportunity around propensity to call around, duration of calls everything we're seeing is lining up behind that very clearly."", '\nTony Staffieri -- Chief Financial Officer\nSimon, we had talked about, our overage revenue being just under 5% of the total service revenue.', ""\nJoe Natale -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nOn the election front, I don't anticipate a lot of change or departure from what we've said in the past."", '\nOperator\nOur next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.', '\nAnd so that would be one of the more significant impacts that impacted our ARPU within the quarter.', '\nAnd hopefully that answers your question on the first part.', '\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Vince Valentini of TD Securities.', '\nVince Valentini -- TD Securities -- Analyst\nThanks very much.', '\nAnd the second question is, I mean you seem very positive about the underlying trends on the move to Internet and unlimited plans and the data usage increases the cost savings and so forth.', ""\nIn terms of financing the total cost, whether it's the tax costs, whether it's the potential recovery value at the end of term etc."", '\nTony Staffieri -- Chief Financial Officer\nIf I could pick up on that Vince, in answer to the other part of your question.', '\nAnd so, when I made previous comments about the ARPU declines in the base, relative to our expectations that would be an additional factor for it.', ""\nNotwithstanding that, we continue to post good cost efficiency numbers, if you are to look at our wireless costs for this quarter, they're down 8% year-on-year."", ""\nSo I think what you see is an underlying business with good road map, we've talked about cost program delivering consistent improvements each quarter sequentially and year-on-year and you're seeing that, it just has that overage revenue comes down in the three factors that I talked about, it's really masking that underlying trend."", '\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Maher Yagi of Desjardins.', '\nMaher Yaghi -- Desjardins Securities -- Analyst\nThanks for taking my question.', '\nAnd then finally, as I said the subsidy piece of it, our expectation was with reduced subsidy in the market, that it would not only help ARPU because of the accounting that I talked about in reducing the offset to it, but also reduce the net subsidy cost and that was expected to be in the range of CAD50 million to a CAD100 million in the back half of the year.', '\nOperator\nOur -- comes from Drew McReynolds of RBC.', '\nDrew McReynolds -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nYeah, thanks very much.', ""\nAnd then second kind of back to kind of Vince's I guess attempt on 2020 I'll make the same attempt."", '\nWhen we look inside this base, just to repeat the point from earlier, we are seeing that an Infinite customer on average their recurring ARPU is up 1% or 2% after this migration dynamic.', ""\nWe saw what was done well -- wasn't done so well and we saw that come out the other side with growing ARPU, with cost improvements with a margin that was up 10 points, and vastly simpler business to manage and navigate and very different subsidy economics."", ""\nTony Staffieri -- Chief Financial Officer\nOn the second part of your question Drew in terms of 2020 EBITDA, again I -- we don't want to make this a Guidance Call for 2020."", ""\nOn the cost side of it, you should expect us to continue to deliver the type of absolute cost reductions and efficiencies that you've seen and we're fairly confident about our cost program on that."", '\nDrew McReynolds -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nYup.', '\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Jeff Fan of Scotiabank.', '\nTony Staffieri -- Chief Financial Officer\nOn the second part of your question, Jeff.', '\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Tim Casey of BMO.', '\nTim Casey -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThanks.', ""\nJoe Natale -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I'll take the first one, and Tony grab the second one."", '\nSo, bear in mind that we talked earlier that we saw a 13% reduction in calls this quarter, right, as a whole as a business, 30% reduction is significant.', '\nTony Staffieri -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd the second part of your question, Tim, related to the Ignite migrations.', '\nTim Casey -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThank you.', '\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Richard Choe of J.', '\nRichard Choe -- J.', '\nRichard Choe -- J.', '\nTony Staffieri -- Chief Financial Officer\nRichard we entered the shift on with

true to that based on relative market prices between the two.', ""\nAdam Ilkowitz -- Citigroup -- Analyst\nJust if you're seeing a greater mix of BYOD customers pressuring ARPU as well?"",

"'\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and [Inaudible 2020 third-quarter financial results conference call.', '\nMost of our businesses were shut down, and this had a huge impact on our third-quarter results.', ""\nSince our last earnings call, we've begun a responsible phased reopening of our parks in Shanghai, Paris, Tokyo, and Orlando as well as our shopping and dining area, Downtown Disney in Anaheim."", '\nThis is a significant milestone and a reaffirmation of our strategy for growth.', ""\nLike many companies, we've had to find innovative ways to conduct our business during the pandemic."", ""\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Christine."", '\nWe estimate the adverse impact of COVID-19-related disruption on our third quarter segment operating income was approximately $3 billion, net of cost mitigations.', '\nAs we reopened many of our businesses, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs related to addressing the safety of our cast members, talent and guests as well as various government regulations.', '\nAt parks, experiences, and products, third quarter results largely reflect the closures of our domestic parks and resorts, cruise line business and Disneyland Paris for the entirety of the quarter.', '\nThese results also reflect an adverse impact at our consumer products business due to the effects of COVID-19.', '\nAt Studio Entertainment, operating income decreased in the quarter as higher TV SVOD distribution results, lower home entertainment marketing costs, and lower film impairments were more than offset by lower theatrical distribution results.', '\nHigher TV SVOD results were driven by content sales to Disney+, including library titles, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, and Onward, partially offset by a decrease in sales to third parties in the pay window.', '\nThese increases were partially offset by lower advertising revenue.', '\nTotal broadcasting ad revenue was down 17% in the quarter, driven by decreases at our owned television stations and the ABC Network.', '\nAt ESPN, lower programming and production costs were largely due to the deferral of rights costs for the NBA and Major League Baseball.', ""\nAssuming the resumption of live sports continues as planned, we expect ESPN's ad sales in Q4, including the benefit of the 53rd week, to benefit significantly, particularly from the NBA."", '\nDuring the third quarter, we launched Disney+ in India via our Disney+ Hotstar service, and France via a strategic partnership with Canal, and in Japan via a limited launch with NTT DOCOMO.', '\nResults at our direct-to-consumer businesses had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of about $200 million, which came in better than the guidance we provided last quarter, primarily due to the better-than-expected results at Disney+ and Hulu.', '\nAdditional detail can be found in our 10-Q, which we expect to file shortly.', ""\nConsolidating Hulu's operating losses and netting out intersegment eliminations resulted in a positive contribution to total segment operating income of about $490 million."", '\nWe ended the quarter with $23 billion in cash and continue to feel we are well positioned to navigate through this time of uncertainty and continue to invest in the long-term future growth of our businesses.', ""\nAt parks, experiences, and products, it's worth noting that while Walt Disney World is operating at a positive net contribution level, the upside we are seeing from reopening is less than we'd originally expected given the recent surge in COVID-19 cases in Florida."", ""\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Lowell, and we will be happy to take your questions."", '\nLowell Singer -- Senior Vice President of Investor Relations\nOK.', '\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\nOperator instructions Our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JP Morgan.', '\nAlexia Quadrani -- J.',

Senior Vice President of Investor Relations\nOK.', '\nBob Chapek -- Chief Executive Officer\nOK.', '\nLowell Singer -- Senior Vice President of Investor Relations\nAnd then on the parks question, Bob, maybe you want to speak to demand.', '\nAnd then, unfortunately, COVID struck again, and all the numbers started going up.', ""\nBut we're very happy that we're returning a positive net contribution, as Christine said, because that was our goal in the first place, while, at the same time, operating very responsibly."", ""\nChristine McCarthy -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial

positive contribution level."", '\nLowell Singer -- Senior Vice President of Investor Relations\nOK.', '\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.', ""\nLowell Singer -- Senior Vice President of Investor Relations\nThanks for the questions, Ben, and I'll turn those over to Bob."", '\nBob Chapek -- Chief Executive Officer\nOK.', '\nThis will be rooted in our own content, from ABC Studios, Fox TV, FX, Freeform, Searchlight, and 20th Century.', ""\nAll I'll say about our research is that it shows that such an offering under a premier access offering not only gets us revenue from the original transaction from the PVOD but also acts as a fairly large stimulus to sign up for Disney+."", '\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America.', '\nChristine McCarthy -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nOK.', ""\nAnd it wasn't a full -- I would call it a limited launch."", ""\nSo, I think you can anticipate that once it is launched, there will be more demand for Disney+ in that market because you're absolutely right."", '\nLowell Singer -- Senior Vice President of Investor Relations\nAnd then Jessica had a question about restarting production as well.', '\nAs I mentioned, we will be capitalizing many of those costs that are related to productions.', '\nLowell Singer -- Senior Vice President of Investor Relations\nOK.', '\nJohn Hodulik -- UBS -- Analyst\nOK.', ""\nAre you confident that you've got a strong-enough lineup that you can sustain the growth that you've recently seen both in the U."", '\nLowell Singer -- Senior Vice President of Investor Relations\nOK, John.', '\nBob Chapek -- Chief Executive Officer\nOK.', ""\nAnd these require us to reenter into production, but it's such a priority that we're hopeful that this will be coming shortly to enable us to, again, not only sustain but continue to grow."", ""\nAnd we all believe that, that decision provided the company with additional financial flexibility, given what we were seeing in the COVID environment we're in and all the uncertainty that we're dealing with and continue to deal with."", '\nJohn Hodulik -- UBS -- Analyst\nGreat.', ""\nAnd I wonder, just generally, what â\x80\x93 you know, what risk is there to affiliate fees if those seasons don't get completed?"", '\nLowell Singer -- Senior Vice President of Investor Relations\nOK.', '\nLowell Singer -- Senior Vice President of Investor Relations\nOK, Michael.', '\nJason Bazinet -- Citi -- Analyst\nI love that you guys are always conservative with the capital, and recognize you said it was a low-cost of debt in terms of the latest capital raise.', '\nLowell Singer -- Senior Vice President of Investor Relations\nOK, Jason.', '\nAnd, you know, when we raised that money, it was back in March and April.', '\nAnd one, you know, is just the way that we have probably been much better at cost mitigation than we anticipated.', '\nAnd as a CFO, I would never want to be in that position of not being able to fund all of our obligations.', ""\nJason Bazinet -- Citi -- Analyst\nThat makes perfect sense, but none of that capital was really earmarked to sort of pulling the minority stake in Hulu that you don't own."", ""\nSo we've got some debt maturities that we don't have to go-to-market."", '\nIs there an alternative state of the world where ESPN could go direct to consumers?', ""\nAnd we have, as you've heard today, accelerated our push into DTC consumer streaming and, with the same time, you're seeing a decline in the subscriber, MVPD subscriber base outside of the U."", '\nAnd so, we have, in this fiscal year, have already closed down more than 20 channels.', '\nBob Chapek -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd in terms of the ESPN question, let me first start off by saying that, on a macro level, you know, I think we understand the value of live sports.', '\nSo, then the question is, how do we get it to the consumer?', '\nAs you think about the next stage of growth for Disney+, does it make more sense to kind of go after a bigger market of subscribers, which can be pretty expensive in terms of original content?', ""\nAnd you could say that that's probably because people haven't been in the parks for a while."", ""\nSo, the per-caps are great, and I think it's because people haven't been able to, you know, get into our parks for quite a long time."", ""\nBob Chapek -- Chief Executive Officer\nAll I'll follow up on the parks question is that, as you know, different guests, depending on where they're coming from, have different relative values in terms of their contribution as a guest to the park."", '\nAnd I think Christine handled the pricing and occupancy in hotels.', '\nAs I mentioned, one of the biggest things in terms of subscriber acquisition is having new hot tentpole content to bring to the service, and you get that by making investments in new content.', '\nWe make these

"'\nOperator\nGood afternoon, and welcome to the Enanta Pharmaceuticals fiscal first quarter 2022 financial results conference call.', '\nJay Luly, president and CEO.', '\nEnanta has a successful and proven history of discovering and developing antiviral treatment, as demonstrated by glecaprevir, the HCV protease inhibitor component and MAVYRET, a leading treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus.', '\nOur most advanced RSV program is our N-protein inhibitor, EDP-938, which has fast track designation and is currently in three phase 2 studies in multiple patient populations.', '\nWe are excited by the potential of EDP-938, which is a potent inhibitor of the RSV N-protein that has shown robust clinical data in a phase 2a challenge study, where it was not only safe and well tolerated, but also demonstrated significant effects on viral load and reduced symptoms of infection.', '\nWe are on track to report top line data from RSP next quarter.', '\nThese studies, which were initiated after RSVP, are expected to extend at least end of 2023.', '\nPreclinical data demonstrated nanomolar potency across the major RSV subtypes, RSV-A and RSV-B and good absorption and plasma exposure across multiple different species.', '\nTurning to SARS-CoV-2.', '\nIn preclinical studies, EDP-235 demonstrated highly potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and pharmacokinetic properties supporting a once-a-daily oral dosing regimen without the need for a boosting agent, such as ritonavir, all which indicates the potential of EDP-235 as a best-in-class compound.', '\nLike with RSV, there are a number of vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, adults with underlying pulmonary disease, and those who are immune compromised.', '\nEDP-514, our HBV core inhibitor with fast track designation, has been evaluated in two phase 1b studies in different chronic HBV patient population.', ""\nBefore moving to the financials, I'd like to wrap up by reiterating our upcoming milestones."", '\nFinally, we look forward to initiating a phase 1 study for EDP-323, our RSV L-inhibitor and nominating a human metapneumovirus clinical candidate in the second half of this year.', '\nThis compares to total revenue of 31.', '\nTherefore, royalties for our fiscal first quarter ending December 31st are calculated at the highest royalty rate for the year, and royalties for our fiscal quarter ending March 31st will be calculated at 10%, our lowest royalty rate tier in our fiscal year.', '\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2021, research and development expenses totaled 48.', '\nEnanta recorded a minor income tax benefit related to the release of the state tax reserve for the three months ended December 31, 2021, compared to an income tax benefit of 3.', '\nEnanta ended of the quarter with 347.', '\nBrian Abrahams -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nHey.', ""\nAnd so again, I think we've built some advantages into EDP-235 from a potency standpoint, from a PK standpoint, from a tissue targeting standpoint."", '\nBrian Abrahams -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGreat.', ""\nJay Luly -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nMaybe I'll let Natalie comment on some of these."", '\nAnd so we would expect something, I would say -- and if I have to guess, I would say something along the line of the [Inaudible.', '\nUnknown Analyst\nOK.', ""\nJay Luly -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSo we're going to focus post RSVP on high-risk patient populations."", '\nUnknown Analyst\nOK.', '\nWe hope to be the first or certainly among a small number of drugs that could be approved in RSV over a reasonable time frame.', '\nAnd so I think having an inhibitor like 938 is great, has high barrier.', ""\nAgain, we'll have it in the clinic in the second half, and we'll be tracking hopefully, a very successful other pathway using our N protein and EDP-928."", ""\nBut -- so to demonstrate good viral kinetics and good safety, and that setting was further derisking, now we're taking one step further and doing it with real-world virus or real-world infection, I should say, so that people are catching the stream that's going around, presenting in a very natural way to a treater and then we treat them."", '\nRoy Buchanan -- JMP Securities -- Analyst\nGreat.', ""\nJay Luly -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I mean, you're always doing other kinds of ancillary studies along the way in development, such as DDI studies."", '\nRoy Buchanan -- JMP Securities -- Analyst\nYes.', '\nJay Luly -- President and Chief Executive

Analyst\nGreat.', '\nZegbeh Jallah -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst\nGood afternoon.', '\nBut I think I was just kind of curious about symptom improvement being a primary endpoint for the phase 2b study?', ""\nZegbeh Jallah -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst\nAnd then I'm sure you get this one a lot, but just kind of curious about the five-day treatment period with the RSVP study."", '\nJay Luly -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I guess you could never really know the answer to that without doing the study, but what we did find in this patient population that with RSVP, we think it will substantially mirror the challenge study, that should be -- we think that should be adequate.', '\nZegbeh Jallah -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst\nGot it.', '\n2021, our revenues came in lower than what AbbVie guided at the beginning of the year, which was 2 billion, and I think it came in at 1.', ""\nPaul Mellett -- Chief Financial Officer\nRegarding what happens after 2022, it's really all up to the COVID pandemic situation."", '\nJay Luly -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nAnd to answer your other question, so if we were doing a combination study, we would add the drugs together at the same time.', '\nZegbeh Jallah -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst\nThanks, guys.', ""\nRegarding your question about combos, there's no indication right now that you need combos."", ""\nBut in any event to your direct question, I don't see the need at this time to be doing those combination studies."", '\nJay Olson -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst\nOK.', ""\nJay Luly -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI'm sorry, did you have another question?"", '\nRoanna Ruiz -- SVB Leerink Partners -- Analyst\nThanks.', '\nSo you just need to understand what other concomitant meds patients are on and understand what potential impact ritonavir would have?', '\nRoanna Ruiz -- SVB Leerink Partners -- Analyst\nYes, makes sense.', '\nI think one of the other things just during the pandemic, the transplant recipients are probably among the most cautious people, right, because they are immune suppressed.', '\nRoanna Ruiz -- SVB Leerink Partners -- Analyst\nYes.', '\nLiisa Bayko -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nHi.', ""\nAnd then your other question, obviously, we'll be preparing for the steps in phase 2, 3 after the phase 1 is to get into that as quickly as we can,

2020.', '\nIn addition, we are continuing to evaluate and execute strategic price increases for both brands to offset rising raw material and freight costs.', '\n1 priority is to build a more diverse,

partially offset by price increases.', '\nA key reason for the lower cash position is due to the inventory build of $31.', '\nAs a result, we have adjusted our outlook for the balance of the fiscal year.', '\nWe expect year-over-year increase is primarily related to incremental inbound and outbound freight expense and expected deleverage on overhead costs, more than offset by price increases.',

to be watching.', ""\nJohn Enwright -- Chief Financial Officer\nThe only thing I would add to that, Rob, if you think about Pura Vida in the stores, the apparel business, when the consumer gets the opportunity to touch and feel and the quality of the apparel business, we're seeing them engage with that product much more broadly than they do when they're online."", '\nOliver Chen -- Cowen and

part of the question, Oliver, what I'll do is talk about the risks and opportunities because I think both are really important."", '\nSo I would say gas is by far the largest risk.', ""\nBut I think it's important to talk about opportunity because if you back up and you think about what's going to company, I think that there's three big macro impacts that have impacted us."", ""\nAnd as we have more stores that will help us, as we get all of the work that we're investing now in terms of the data platform and rebuilding the performance marketing organization, I think that that's another big lift."", '\nOliver Chen -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nRob Wallstrom -- Chief Executive Officer\nJohn, do you want to take to the inventories and I can talk about.', '\nOliver Chen -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nJohn, in terms of the inventory cancellations, which ones did you -- mean which parts of the inventory needed to be canceled?', ""\nRob Wallstrom -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, I think the only thing I would add to that, Oliver, if you just think about what's been happening in our factory channel, right, this gas price has gone up, business has slowed."",

impact of opening Pura Vida stores.', '\nRob Wallstrom -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, Joe, I can jump into that one.', '\nAnd once we kind of evaluate, I would say, this fall, how all the new stores are performing.', '\nJoe Gomes -- Noble Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOK.', ""\nJohn Enwright -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, so we saw a little bit in the second quarter flow through because we weren't finalized with all the plans really in the middle part of the second quarter."", '\nJoe Gomes -- Noble Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOK.', ""\nRob Wallstrom -- Chief Executive Officer\nThat's a great question, Joe."", '\nAnd the board is very focused on getting those two things accomplished first before highly focusing shall we say, on M&A activity.', '\nJoe Gomes -- Noble Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOK, great.', '\nEric Beder -- Small Cap Consumer Research -- Analyst\nI want to do a follow-up on the $25 million in savings.', '\nJohn Enwright -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, so if you

Wallstrom -- Chief Executive Officer\nI think are couple of things that we've learned from our collaborations is first of all, they are a great way to bring customers into the brand."", '\nSo I think we have to keep that pipeline fresh as we move forward.', ""\nJohn Enwright -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd I think -- just to add on to it, I think it's the execution of product."", '\nEric Beder --

double-digits, either sequentially or year-over-year, however you want handle it, just so we have an appreciation for how much is that business is benefiting from the PCI versus the volume side of the equation there?', '\nScott M.', '\nWe did the same thing with EDC as well.', '\nWe were purposeful in activating around that and looking to achieve ever increasing values on EDC.', '\nWe did that in our GCO business, where we announced price increases in Q4 against strong volume, purposely held some volume back as well there to activate around that and in any case, when we were the only ones with the price increase on the table, we achieved the price increase and got the volume.', '\nScott M.', '\nFrank, Frank, if you think of that price is at least 3 or 4 times depending on what comparison

the disclosure in the press release, in the supplemental financial package and in SEC filings.', ""\nFactors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in the press release and from time to time in the company's periodic filings with the SEC."", '\nTransactions during the year reached a record, exceeding $11 billion as cap rates further compressed and are now on par with multi-family.', '\nOverall, despite the uncertainty within the macroeconomy, fundamentals in the student housing industry remain healthy and we believe that the stability of our business will continue to make student housing one of the most sought-after investments globally.', '\nOur operational and asset management efforts resulted in annual expense growth for our controllable categories of approximately 1.', '\nAs always, the low and high ends of our revenue guidance reflects execution risk of our fall lease-up, backfilling short-term leases, summer leasing initiatives and outcome of our other income growth projections.', '\nAs the average number of new beds per market receiving new supply is expected to decrease 20% from last year.', '\nThe redevelopment of Calhoun Hall Honors Residence at Drexel University, which will house first year honor students is now a third-party development.', ""\nAccording to CBRE's 2018 year-end student housing report, transactions totaled over $11 billion for 2018, highlighted by the Greystar-Blackstone acquisition of EDR."", ""\nWith that, I'll now turn it over to Daniel to discuss our year-end financial results and 2019 guidance."", '\nAs you will see in our own development update on Page S-10 of the earnings supplemental, we have commenced construction on $765 million of development for delivery through 2021, with $525 million remaining to be funded over the next three years.', '\nWe already completed increase in our line of credit from $700 million to $1 billion and a new $200 million term loan anticipated to close in the second half of the year.', ""\nWe've provided an FFOM guidance range of $2."", '\nExcluding these costs, FFOM guidance would have been $2.', '\nWhen we move into the summer semesters, as typically experienced, we expect to see lower seasonal revenue growth impacting the second and third quarters.', '\nAlso, third-party fee revenue in the range of $26 million to $30 million is included in guidance for the year.', '\nAs a result, from an accounting perspective, we are required to increase both third-party revenue and expenses by the estimated $3.', ""\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions And this morning's first question comes from Shirley Wu from Bank of America."", ""\nShirley Wu -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nSo given your experience that you've experienced so far with elevated supply at FSU, what do you guys plan on doing differently going into '19?"", ""\nBill Bayless -- Chief Executive Officer\nI'm sorry, Shirley."", '\nShirley Wu -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nOK.', ""\nBill Bayless -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes, and Tallahassee is one of the markets that we talked about on last quarter's call, but certainly given the supply that's coming in is an area of a short-term concern for us."", '\nWe were a little conservative in our guidance this year, given the new supply that is coming in.', ""\nOur velocity is significantly outpacing last year, and so we believe we are in a position that we will do OK in Tali from what we've assumed in our guidance."", ""\nAnd so from a floor plan design, from a programmatic design, the development of the Disney Education Center is exactly on par with all the honors college developments that we've done at ASU, Northern Arizona, University of Arizona."", '\nOperator\nAnd the next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi.', '\nWe have, at the midpoint -- well, we have a range of $100 million to $190 million in total disposition capital for this year.', '\nNick Joseph -- Citi -- Analyst\nSo just to follow-up on that, so guidance is assuming about $150 million of dispositions at the midpoint, but it could be up to $300 million of the combination of dispositions and equity, but right now, guidance assumes that that is debt, is that right?', '\nOperator\nAnd the next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc.', '\nAustin Wurschmidt -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\nJust curious, how much appetite does your capital partner have to continue to partner on joint ventures in the disposition side?', '\nAustin Wurschmidt -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\nAnd then you mentioned in your prepared remarks that cap rates had compressed further in the fourth quarter.', '\nBill Bayless -- Chief Executive Officer\nOK.', '\nBill Bayless -- Chief Executive Officer\nYou got to break them into two categories, in that the majority of those assets are on-campus residence halls where you would see your rate profile be in the area of 2.', '\nOperator\nAnd the next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore.', ""\nSamir Khanal -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nBill or Daniel, I guess, I guess, what gives you the confidence that you'll be able to hit the midpoint or the lower end of the expense range that you provided for '19?"", ""\nSo just trying to get color around sort of expense growth here and how you're thinking about it."", '\nThat is primarily driven by our expectations for a moderation in property tax growth.', ""\nWe do have a few markets where we expect big reassessments this year that's built into our 4%, but we already have some of the new assessments in for 2019."", ""\nWe've really tried to build in and allow for that better this year in our incident response budget."", '\nIf you remember, I think, we came in at 1.', '\nSamir Khanal -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nJust as a follow-up on the reassessment.', '\nSamir Khanal -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nOK.', ""\nBill Bayless -- Chief Executive Officer\nFor us, that's something that we look at in concert with our overall capital allocation opportunities."", ""\nWe look at presales and there is always good opportunities out there, but we are very selective in analyzing them in concert with the growth profile going forward and line them up against the capital allocation we have for our own development, and so that's something -- the pipeline is good, but we only choose to execute when it makes sense and it is not our highest priority with our development opportunities."", '\nOperator\nAnd the next question comes from Daniel Bernstein with Capital One.', ""\nDaniel Bernstein -- Capital One Securities -- Analyst\nJust wanted to ask about the capital recycling guidance for '19."", '\nI thought maybe the recycling number would be a little bit higher?', ""\nWe also did an additional $245 million of dispositions that we actually didn't anticipate when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year, but the Disney project came together during the year and we wanted to get capital in place for that project on the front end, so we felt comfortable with committing to a five-year development there."", '\nDaniel Bernstein -- Capital One Securities -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nDaniel Bernstein -- Capital One Securities -- Analyst\nOK.', ""\nOperator\nAnd the next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill."", ""\nAlexander Goldfarb -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\nSo I appreciate the comments on the equity side for capital funding."", '\nBill Bayless -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, what we have from a debt standpoint is, as we talked about, we already closed on an expansion of our revolver to more match up with the size of our ongoing development pipeline.', ""\nAlexander Goldfarb -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\nOK."", '\nBill Bayless -- Chief Executive Officer\nNet-net, it went down $100 million because you paid the $130 million, it was about $139 million, I think, on the Core Spaces deal.', ""\nAlexander Goldfarb -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\nOK."", '\nBill Bayless -- Chief Executive Officer\nI mean, look, we always look at that.', ""\nAnd so we don't see any reason to change that capital allocation strategy at this point."", '\nAnd so our 5% of assets kind of development strategy we think continues to make sense as well.', '\nOperator\nOperator instructions And the next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.', '\nJohn Pawlowski -- Green Street Advisors -- Analyst\nWilliam, a question for you on opportunity zones.', '\nJohn Pawlowski -- Green Street Advisors -- Analyst\nAnd then, Jennifer, maybe a question for you on just the sensitivity to rental rate growth with the financial markets.', '\nJennifer Beese -- Chief Operating Officer\nFirst question ever.', '\nJennifer Beese -- Chief Operating Officer\nWe do not see any fluctuation right now on our rental rates at this time.', ""\nBill Bayless -- Chief Executive Officer\nIf you look, John, long term, whenever we've seen the macro environment change, certainly, throughout the great recession would be the greatest evidence."", ""\nThe only time that we have ever really seen it in the company's history and you really got to go back and it was before the modern supply of student housing at the levels that it was today is back in the early 2000's, in '01, '02 and in Austin or at University of Colorado, which has the Broomfield, Northern Denver sub-market, you would see multi-family softness somewhat impact and this is back when students didn't have the purpose-built product in walking distance to campus, but there was more of a shadow market in that multi-family, you'd start to see impacts then, but we have not seen in the last 15 years at all."", ""\nDaniel Perry -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd if I can pile on to Bill there, if you go back '08, '09 and '10, I think, that is a pretty perfect correlation to the scenario you're asking about, John."", ""\nBill Bayless -- Chief Executive Officer\nThe demographic rate may be slowing but the enrollment at the institutions that we're serving is not and this is the way you have to look at."", '\nWe always talk about our home State of Texas, the top 6% of high school students get into A&M and UT.', '\nOperator\nAnd that concludes the question-and-answer session and I would like to turn the call back over to our management for any closing comments.', ""\nBill Bayless -- Chief Executive Officer\nIn closing, we'd like to first thank the entire American Campus team

"'\nOperator\nGreetings, and welcome to the EnPro Industries fourth-quarter 2020 earnings conference call.', '\nThe impact of the foreign exchange rate changes subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter, impacts from further spread of COVID-19, and environmental, and litigation charges.', '\nThe company believes reporting adjusted EPS in this manner better reflects the core operating results and offers a more meaningful measure for a comparison against prior periods, a full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted EPS is included in the appendix at the end of the accompanying presentation.', ""\nHistorical data for the new reporting structure is available at the investor relations section of EnPro's company website."", ""\nAnd now, I'll turn the call over to Marvin."", '\nOur organization continues to remain vigilant about enhancing safety protocols, updating operating processes, and adapting to new ways of working.', '\nOver the last year, we have made progress in our commitment to our employees and society, including establishing our charitable foundation with an initial commitment of $1 million in support of education, equality, diversity, and the preservation of human dignity as announced in our February 11 press release.', '\nFirst, I am pleased to report better-than-expected fourth-quarter results.', ""\nWith approximately $230 million of cash on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter, an untapped revolver, and our relentless focus on cash generation, we're well positioned to consider additional bolt-on acquisition opportunities."", '\nAs we look back over the year, we have adjusted successfully to pandemic conditions and are now in the final stage of our COVID pandemic response plan.', '\nWe hold the safety of our team members to the highest standards, while they continue to deliver the exceptional level of service that EnPro customers expect.', '\nAnd fourth, maximizing long-term shareholder returns through a commitment to disciplined capital allocation.', '\nOur remaining STEMCO heavy-duty truck business will now be focused on high-margin wheel, and sealing systems, and suspension components.', '\nAnd our semiconductor business, including LeanTeq.', '\nDuring this integration, our growth initiatives focused on geographic and product range expansion.', '\nOver the past year, the business has maintained its high-profit margins while increasing revenue approximately 40% driven by continued demand for advanced node semiconductor chip.', ""\nWhile we are still in the early stages of integrating this business, its potential contribution is every bit as promising as LeanTeq's."", '\nWith Alluxa, we anticipate a strong first quarter, given their order intake momentum and backlog heading into the year, which gives us great confidence in the initial stages of the acquisition.', '\nExcluding the impact of foreign exchange translation, and sales from acquired and divested businesses, sales for the quarter declined 1.', '\nGross profit margin of 37.', '\nCorporate expenses for the quarter were $10.', '\nWe believe presenting adjusted EPS in this manner better reflects core operating results and offers a more meaningful measure for comparison against prior periods.', '\ngovernment associated with the uranium mine remediation, which is included in other noncurrent assets.', '\nSealing Technologies, which includes Garlock, STEMCO, and the Technetics sealing business, had sales of $154.', '\nOn a sequential basis, sales in the fourth quarter decreased 2%.', '\nImproved margin was driven primarily by production in operational cost reduction initiatives and by portfolio reshaping in the segment.', '\nLeanTeq is showing strength as the five-nanometer platform is ramping quickly, and we are responding to demand with agility by expanding our capacity in Taiwan and the U.', '\nFor the fourth quarter, adjusted segment EBITDA increased 57.', '\nSequentially, sales increased approximately 9% as we saw demand rebound in automotive and general industrial markets.', '\nDuring the fourth quarter, we financed the Alluxa acquisition through a combination of $238 million of cash, and rollover equity from Alluxa executives equating to 7% of the acquisition price.', '\nDuring the fourth quarter, we paid a $0.', '\nNow I want to provide a high-level look at the impact of our portfolio reshaping on sales, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margins.', '\nThis information shows the trailing effect of portfolio changes, and we expect our strategic actions to enhance sales growth and margin improvement in the years ahead.', '\nWe expect adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.', ""\nEnPro's success will be determined by our inherent commitment to our profitable growth strategy, our experienced leadership team, our increasingly diverse and dedicated workforce our strong financial position, and our focus on driving long-term shareholder value."", '\nJeff Hammond -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\nSo just -- I know a lot of moving pieces, but I think, Milt, you mentioned the 6% to 10% growth from a pro forma standpoint.', ""\nSo we're going into 2021 on a pro forma basis because this assumes that the Alluxa acquisition happened at the 1st of 2020 as well as the divestitures and heavy-duty truck, the move in Dieuze in GGB, that all those things happened at the 1st of 2020."", '\nJeff Hammond -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\nAnd as you look at the three segments, do you think the growth rates within each of those on an organic basis are going to be similar?', '\nSo we might see a little bit more growth in STEMCO this year than we would typically see.', ""\nBut our other business and Engineered is CPT, and that's impacted on the downside by oil and gas."", '\nJeff Hammond -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nI guess, on kind of robust growth, I would have thought the incremental margins would have given a bigger lift than kind of flattish or slightly up EBITDA margins.', ""\nIt's still a nice increase year over year."", '\nJeff Hammond -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\nHow much of the temp costs do you have coming back?', '\nMilt Childress -- Chief Financial Officer\nWe estimate that we were able to take out roughly $30 million as a result of the initiatives that we put in place last year.', ""\nAnd then obviously, we have year-over-year cost increases that we're managing that are offsets against the permanent reductions."", '\nJeff Hammond -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOK, very helpful.', '\nAnd so if you look at our biggest currency exposure, it would be the euro, and I think it was $1.', ""\nAnd we'll comment on that as the year progresses."", ""\nSo we're real thoughtful in how we thought about the full year, taking those things into consideration."", ""\nBut I think it's mindful."", '\nAs we look forward from the recent more material-sized acquisitions that sort of added new legs to the business, are you thinking of additional lights to the business?', ""\nMarvin Riley -- Chief Executive Officer\nThat's a great -- that's a really, really good question."", ""\nWe're building on skillsets and capabilities that we have in the business."", '\nWe like to attract these segments with strong growth.', ""\nAnd I hope that's helpful."", '\nBut I mean, should I think of the remaining sort of unpaid environmental liabilities to sort of be that around $30 million, thinking about that $13 million in 2021, plus a few million going out over the following five years.', ""\nEssentially, what we tried to provide or what I tried to provide on the call was just an indication of what to expect from a cash outlay over the next few years because we've had some pretty large reserve increases this year."", '\nAnd as you know, liabilities of this type have really long tails.', '\nOperator\nWe reached the end of our question-and-answer session.'"

"'\nOperator\nGood morning and thank you for standing by, and welcome to the SkyWater Technology third quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call.', ""\nHeather Davis -- Investor Relations\nGood morning and welcome to SkyWater's third quarter fiscal 2021 conference call."", '\nDuring the call, any statements made about our future financial results and business are forward-looking statements.', '\nDuring this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures.', '\nInterestingly, in addition to technology and market-driven paradigm shifts, the supply chain challenges across industries, which you are now no doubt hearing about, highlight the need for our nation to enhance domestic infrastructure.', '\nThere is the unique infrastructure these technologies require to scale and to make SkyWater and the U.', '\nSupply constraints and delays in expected U.', '\nThese investments outpaced revenue growth in our quarter and were the primary drivers of gross margin of negative 5.', '\nAll of this gives us a strong conviction in our long-term model.', '\nIn addition to what we believe are favorable market conditions for semiconductors today, we believe SkyWater is well aligned to the long-term growth trends that demand services offered through our unique engagement model for the development and production of new technologies.', '\nIn addition, we are a volume manufacturer, which then means that customers also get the benefit of high yields and automotive level quality when their product goes into production as well as the IP security benefits of performing development and manufacturing onshore.', '\nThe ability to handle development projects from R&D to volume production gives us a lot of stickiness with our customers.', '\nUltimately, a successful ATS program will conclude with our customers moving into wafer services, which is when they scale their product to volume production and do so with their process flow designed to run at SkyWater.', '\nThe other key component of our TAAS model is that it lowers our capital intensity.', '\nThis approach enables the necessary development and subsequent production required to monetize the IP, co-develop with our customers with low capital intensity and strong mutual benefit.', ""\nWe continue to see increasing momentum and customer interest for our unique AP capabilities, and I'm really excited about the future of our Florida facility."", '\nThis partner is currently working with their end customer on system qualification, and we anticipate that the wafer services ramp for this platform will begin with revenue generation in 2022.', '\nStarting in the second quarter 2021, we began hiring for a range of roles, key to scaling the output in our Minnesota fab in response to strong customer demand.', '\nSkyWater was not immune to the challenges in the supply chain for semiconductors this quarter, we talked about increased lead time for tools in our last call.', ""\nThese large-scale programs have multiple dependencies, and it's sometimes challenging to forecast the exact timing of these R&D-related milestone achievements."", '\nWe are a rapidly growing company, ramping a complex business in a dynamic macro environment.', '\nATS revenue was impacted by the customer program that is being reconstructed and expected to recommence in 2022.', '\nThis moves our revenue recognition from the third and fourth quarters of 2021 into early 2022.', '\nBoth GAAP and non-GAAP gross profit and margin declined due to increased cost of revenue.', '\nWe continue to make investments for the long-term growth of the company by building out our rad-hard and advanced packaging capabilities.', '\nR&D in the third quarter was $2.', '\nThe increase was driven primarily by public company costs for and stock-based compensation.', '\nAs a result of this pay-down, total debt outstanding was $35.', '\nResearch and development expenses are anticipated in about $2 million to $2.', '\nThis gives us confidence in our long-term top line growth model of 25%.', '\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions Your first question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.', '\nSo I got two -- it sounds like I got $2 million of depreciation expenses added into COGS and it sounds like there was some labor costs also that are going into COGS that raised the fixed costs.', '\nAnd we want to be well prepared for the forecast we have for 2022 and the target utilization for 2022 and as I mentioned, long-term investments.', '\nAnd on a year-to-date basis, we had $10.', '\nMark Lipacis -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nSo on a quarterly basis, we have $2 million higher depreciation expense, right?', '\nMark Lipacis -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nOK.', ""\nIs this is something that now is a -- are these costs that you -- you're capitalizing or amortizing."", '\nSo a significant headwind against us on our margin structure but really good foundational investment for long-term growth of the company.', '\nMark Lipacis -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nOK.', ""\nIt's very to find out what those revenue opportunities are."", '\nMark Lipacis -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen & Co.', ""\nSo I'm guessing -- is that a realistic expectation or is it going to be reset to something lower, given that the fundamental structure of the business is changing?"", '\nAs I talked about in the last quarter, obviously as the revenues grow, that will help us to expand our gross margins.', ""\nSteve Manko -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah and I'll just add that the dependent we're doing this year that's very important is moving programs out of ATS into wafer services."", '\nSo overtime, we absolutely believe that the only long-term revenue model is going to hold but also the improvements in gross margin.', '\nSo having a strong ATS business today indicates long-term wafer services growth in the long term.', '\nAnd I would not think of tool -- tools come and go when we engage with the customer.', '\nThomas Sonderman -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, a great question.', ""\nSkyWater will make a lot of money off the mere fact that there's going to be more innovation, more investment going into R&D, which plays very well into our ATS model."", '\ngovernment, in terms of how we can accelerate adding capacity into our Minnesota fab so that you can resolve some of these near-term supply constraints.', '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.', '\nHarsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nThomas Sonderman -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, you can compare the fourth quarter of this year, the fourth quarter of last year for comparison purposes but remember in the fourth quarter of 2020, we have an extra week in the year that was coming through, which is about $2.', '\nHarsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nOK.', '\nSteve Manko -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes, so we definitely have visibility into the changeable nature of what that revenue is.', ""\nWe also had some non-recurring expenses of about $10 million that we funded and paid this year, which are onetime events that we don't expect to continue over the course of 2022."", '\nOperator\nYour last question comes from the line of Raji Gill with Needham & Company.', '\nIs this -- you said multiple programs in ATS in which we -- the revenue is being pushed into 2022.', '\nAre there -- and then separately, there are other ATS programs that are being pushed out because a supply constraint issues, your inability to qualify products.', '\nSteve Manko -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, I can give you some additional color it.', ""\nSo as we achieve those milestones, that's when that revenue will be recognized."", '\nRaji Gill -- Needham and Company -- Analyst\nOK.', ""\nIt's supposed to hit into Q4 but it's going into next year, given the same kind of issues about constraints."", '\nSo how do I think about then that the margins on a go-forward basis?', ""\nOnce that $29 million is placed in service, typically we'd depreciate over a seven-year life."", ""\nThomas Sonderman -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, I'll outline it and, Steve, you can add any color."", '\nAnd then as the programs pick up momentum, the resources get fully deployed, the R&D cycle of learning begins to accelerate.', ""\nBut over time, what you're going to see is as the customer base grows and we fill out that entire funnel, each individual program will have less significant of an impact on our overall model."", ""\nSteve Manko -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd that's what gives us confidence our long-term model still."", ""\nSo it's more a year by year as we go on."", '\nSo good contributions coming through, balancing that pipeline, but it really takes 24 to 36 months for those new ATS programs to really materialize and generate significant revenue.', '\nOperator\nYou do have a follow-up question from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company.', ""\nI'm just kind of curious is, A, is that still the case; and B, if that is the case, how should we think about just the base of services heading into December and also into the March quarter, given the fact that you might see some revenue overflow from the $15 million in March but at the same time there will be seasonality that we went though."", ""\nThomas Sonderman -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, so over time -- and we'll see that we're getting better visibility, as I mentioned."", ""\nBut as we further build out and take these individual program and turn them into platform technology development, that will give us a good baseline to build off on and there won't be as much learning going through in the new R&D programs."", ""\nWe've talked about that increases year over year."", ""\nSteve Manko -- Chief Financial Officer\nThere's significant demand for our wafer services and we're becoming more efficient with the way that we drive that wafer services revenue."", '\nThese factors drive our collective enthusiasm for the future of our company and US-based high-tech manufacturing.']"

"'\nOperator\nHello, and welcome to the Genesis Energy fourth quarter 2021 earnings call and webcast.', '\nThe offshore pipeline transportation segment is engaged in providing the critical infrastructure to move oil produced from the long-lived, world-class reservoirs from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico to onshore refining centers.', '\nTogether, these two projects represent some $12 billion to $15 billion of capital invested over the last several years in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, one of the lowest, if not the lowest carbon footprint crude oil basins in the world.', ""\nI'll now focus on our individual business segments."", '\nWe believe this is a tangible, recent and real valuation marker that should help the investment community whether you\'re on the buy side or the sell side, ""reprice"" our entire offshore segment in your sum of the products valuation models.', '\nThis rapidly increasing demand coupled with, as a practical matter, a net decrease in supply provided a favorable environment for price redetermination for our volumes to be sold in 2022.', '\nDemand in Asia outside of China remains slightly below pre-pandemic levels, but including China, total demand across Asia is now above pre-pandemic levels, even as the market deals with the temporary reduction in economic activity associated with the Chinese New Year and hosting of the Olympic Games.', '\nNo matter what the reported FOB Chinese prices, it is important to note that neither Genesis nor ANSAC sell any volumes directly into the spot market for which its prices are all relevant primarily because of the lengthy supply chain from Green River, Wyoming to Asian markets, as well as the fact that each distinct geographic market has its own supply and demand dynamics, driven in large part by the existence or nonexistence of local synthetic production and the transportation costs from other exporting reasons.', '\nIt is also indicative and reflective of the increased costs faced by Chinese synthetic producers.', ""\nHaving said that, it clearly went up through most of '21, then dipped slightly in anticipation of the events I mentioned earlier and now has reversed and is increasing again."", '\nDemand growth with flat supply will always drive prices higher.', '\nThe Granger expansion representing an incremental 750,000 tons or so of annual production remains on schedule and, importantly, on budget for first production in the third quarter of 2023.', ""\nInterestingly, export prices, FOB Wyoming, are expected to be some $20 per ton higher in 2022 and maybe more in '23 and beyond than those that we were receiving when we originally sanctioned the Granger expansion in the third quarter of 2019."", '\nAlso of note, during the fourth quarter, we saw Sisecam, a multinational glass and chemicals manufacturer out of Europe, acquired a controlling stake in one of our neighbors in Green River, Wyoming.', '\nThe first was the global demand for soda ash was going to continue to grow by approximately 3% per annum at least through 2028 due to the resiliency of end markets and the tailwinds associated with various green initiatives.', '\nThey concluded by suggesting -- they believe there is significant upside potential for future soda ash prices, primarily driven by this increase in demand, rising cost of synthetic production and ESG considerations.', '\nWe continue to see steady demand from our copper mining customers as copper prices remain at or near an all-time high, given its important role in the energy transition, along with being one of the most environmentally friendly methods to handle sulfur entrained in the crude oil consumed at a refinery, we continue to see utility and other manufacturing customers use our sulfur removal by-product to help them reduce harmful emissions in their respective operations.', '\nThis, when combined with the continued retirement of older equipment, has contributed to a net reduction in overall supply of marine tonnage across all classes of Jones Act vessels.', '\nWe would also expect volumes and utilization of our terminals and pipelines in Texas City and South Louisiana.', '\nThis outlook highlights the resiliency of our businesses and demonstrates the tremendous operating leverage we have to overall improving market conditions.', ""\nWith that, I'll turn it back to the moderator for any questions."", '\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions Our first question today is coming from Michael Blum from Wells Fargo.', '\nGrant Sims -- Chief

"""\nOperator\nGood morning, and welcome to Moderna's fourth-quarter 2020 conference call."", '\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to StÃ©phane.', '\nFor the call, we propose to start first by looking back to fiscal-year 2020 and then looking to fiscal-year 2021.', '\n2020 was a historic year for Moderna.', '\nOur COVID-19 vaccine was authorized by the FDA and Canada Health in mid-December, and we shipped 80 million doses to the U.', '\nAnd we anticipated needing multiple capital raises over at least five years until CMV would produce sufficient revenues for Moderna to break even in terms of cash flows and become a self-sustaining company.', '\nWe now have commercial operations in the U.', ""\nWe have become a fully integrated company, and in 12 months, proved that we're capable of running complex Phase 3 studies, scaling up manufacturing to commercial level, making hundreds of millions of doses per year, and building our own commercial network."", '\nThere is no approved CMV vaccine on the market.', '\nDavid Meline -- Chief Financial Officer\nOK.', '\nToday, we are presenting our results primarily on a U.', '\nAs a result of the successful transition to a commercial company, following the emergency use authorization by the FDA and Health Canada in December 2020, we began to record product sales.', '\nFor 2020, we recognized $200 million of product sales for our COVID-19 vaccine, all in late December.', '\nPrior to the authorization of our COVID-19 vaccine, inventory costs were recorded as research and development expenses in the period incurred.', '\nResearch and development expenses were $759 million for Q4 2020, compared to $118 million for the same period in 2019.', '\nExpenses were $188 million for the full-year 2020, compared to $110 million in the prior year.', '\nWe ended Q4 2020 with cash and investments of $5.', '\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $2.', '\nStarting with research and development and SG&A expenses shown on the top left quadrant of Slide 13.', '\nCost of sales includes the cost of goods manufactured, logistics and warehousing costs, as well as third-party royalty costs.', '\nWith this context, let me now move to considerations for 2021, starting with an overview of advanced purchase agreements for our COVID-19 vaccine on Slide 14.', '\nBased on continuous progress to ramp up available supply capacity in our network, we have raised the lower end of our global manufacturing plan for 2021 from 600 million to 700 million doses at the 100-microgram dose level.', '\nFor 2021, we currently model total cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be approximately 20% for the full year, with some variation quarter by quarter, largely driven by the average selling price.',

about earlier that because of the pandemic, things had kind of slowed down a bit, and I think that seems to be the theme.', '\nBalu Balakrishnan -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSo, let me also add, in the longer term, the high-power business has a very bright future because when you look around the world, there are a lot of investments being made in renewables and electrification.', '\nBalu Balakrishnan -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWe have not increased our prices because we have long-term customers.', '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel.', '\nThe last one is our minE-CAP product, which reduces the size of the input capacitor, that also becomes very important in multiport designs, again, for size.', '\nSandeep Nayyar -- Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nSo, I think with the weeks in the channel being so low and the demand still being there.', '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.', '\nBalu Balakrishnan -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nFrom everything we know we believe we can meet the demand -- the actual demand of the customers.', '\nOne is we built a lot of inventory.', '\nBut our goal right now is to keep as much of the inventory with us so that we can serve all the customers.', '\nBalu Balakrishnan -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, there is only one OEM who has gone out-of-the-box in a broad sense.', '\nSo I think in the short-term, the impact is relatively small and known.', '\nSo there is now a strong incentive for OEMs to build attractive chargers that compete directly with aftermarket chargers in terms of size, in terms of power, in terms of multiple ports, which means that our ASP is going to be much higher in these out-of-the-box chargers because now they are competing with aftermarket chargers.', '\nSo overall, we think our content will go up, our dollar profit will go up.', ""\nBalu Balakrishnan -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, we know exactly the total number of cellphones at each and every major OEM, it's well-known information available in the open market."", '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from David Williams from Loop Capital.', '\nBalu Balakrishnan -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nIt is very clear to us is GaN is on an extremely fast growth rate -- growth ramp, right now.', ""\nSo I believe this year, we will get significant -- we'll make significant inroads into OEM business, where they are building high-end chargers for accessories."", ""\nBalu Balakrishnan -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nActually, those short-term issues won't make any difference because the design cycles are so long in automotive."", '\nSo before that, we will start seeing revenues coming from our power supply chips.', '\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Gus Richard from Northland Capital Markets.', '\nGus Richard -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst\nYes, thanks for taking question and let me offer my congratulations to a strong quarter and year.', '\nBalu Balakrishnan -- President and Chief Executive

I was trying to get at the other pieces of your revenue, you expect industrial consumer PC to behave as one would expect in a normal seasonal year?', '\nBalu Balakrishnan -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nIt will be a different seasonality because of the pent-up demand in, for example, in consumer goods, which is appliances.', '\nOperator\nOperator Instructions Your next question

highly successful one for MGP.', '\nOur continued confidence in our company and our tenant was demonstrated when we increased our second quarter 2020 cash dividend to an annualized rate of $1.', '\nDuring the quarter and in July, MGM paid 100% of its rent on time and undertook several key actions to preserve its liquidity position, strengthen its balance sheet and manage its cash outflows to preserve its financial flexibility as the pandemic continues to impact the business.', '\nOur tenant, MGM Resorts, has approximately $4.', '\nWe continue to communicate frequently with various gaming operators and explore sale leaseback transactions that would help them generate immediate liquidity and provide them with an opportunity to replace financial debt with predictable long-term leases.', '\nAndy H.', '\nConsolidated net income was $97 million.', '\nAs James mentioned, we completed the $700 million redemption of our operating partnership units from MGM Resorts pursuant to the $1.',

sense of timing of MGM potentially redeeming the last $700 million of OP units, as well as your thoughts on how long before we may see transaction activity in this sector."", '\nJames C.', '\nSo, as it relates to redemption timing, it is exclusively the option of MGM Resorts.', ""\nAnd then, lastly on C-corp, as I think everyone knows, we've had some new Board members join the board, and anything like that is something that needs to be carefully considered by them."", '\nAndy H.', '\nNo, I think that was pretty well covered.', '\nJoe Greff -- J.', '\nOperator\nThe next question is from Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research.', '\nAndy H.', ""\nIn terms of transactions, redemptions and the timing of it all relative to our leverage, I think we've said from time to time that if a transaction comes along that takes our leverage slightly outside that range but we see a quick path back either through smaller bite-size equity offerings, the ATM or issuance of OP units perhaps to sellers, real estate that we are comfortable doing so."", '\nJames C.', '\nAndy H.', '\nNo, I think that was well said.', '\nOperator\nThe next question is from Spenser Allaway of Green Street Advisors.', '\nJames C.', '\nAndy H.', '\nJames C.', '\nJust to follow-up on that, I would say there has not been a single industry that I can think of that has been more responsive to changing customer tastes than the integrated resort business.', '\nJames C.', '\nOperator\nThe next question is from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank.', '\nJames C.', ""\nThat said, I think that many of the operators, as they look at their own balance sheets and cash flow producing power, are going to find it really interesting to do something with us and get their leverage levels back down to more reasonable levels, given the future earnings power the business, just because we don't -- our leases are very, very long term, incredibly predictable and will prove out to be an attractive option to them versus constantly being in a position of fear over having a piece of debt coming due any one point in time and worrying that if that happens at a point in time when the market is closed, you could end up financing at some really exorbitant rates."", '\nAndy H.', '\nAnd I would add that, I think in those early days, once the cost of capital was figured out, there was support in the bond markets for a lot of these companies and they got that liquidity.', '\nAndy H.', '\nAndy H.', '\nJames C.', '\nOperator\nThe next question is from Steve Sakwa of Evercore.', '\nJames C.', ""\nWell, I think if ever there's been an environment that shows the benefits of having a very strong tenant, it's this one."", ""\nHad we made the decision to diversify our tenant base at an earlier time with almost no exceptions, other than maybe one in the integrated resort business, the tenants have a credit profile that is not as strong as MGM's."", '\nAs we go forward, we evaluate every transaction on a stand-alone basis, and the evaluation takes many factors into consideration, one being the quality of the asset and does it have the enduring value to pay the rent or generate cash flows for 30 straight years, which is the term generally of a lease with us.', '\nSteve Sakwa -- Evercore -- Analyst\nAnd I guess maybe sort of a derivative follow-up on that would just be in terms of other product types.', '\nJames C.', '\nAndy H.', ""\nThe only thing I'd add is just as we look at the financial wherewithal of companies, whether it's gaming or otherwise, and add in an important factor now, which is access to capital, how did they perform in terms of their ability to tap the bond markets, leveraged loan markets, equity markets, and what kind of liquidity options do they have, cash on hand, revolver availability, things like that, across all spaces, and obviously the gaming space showed that they had that availability and access in the space."", '\nJames C.', '\nOperator\nThe next question is from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America.', '\nJames C.', '\nAndy H.', '\nYeah, I think you said it all, James.', '\nShaun Kelley -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nAnd then sort of -- again, a bit of a follow-up from prior question, maybe just asked slightly differently.', '\nJames C.', '\nAndy H.', ""\nYeah, I'll take it James."", '\nJames C.', '\nOperator\nYour next question is from Barry Jonas of Truist Securities.',

-- I think that what will need to happen would be for the industry, the integrated resort REIT industry to get through this intact without any kind of major issues going on with their ability to generate AFFO and thus dividend.', '\nJay Kornreich -- SMBC -- Analyst\nOkay, appreciate that.', '\nJames C.', ""\nI think it's probably more of a question for MGM, although I think that -- I think the timing of both of those different things will be driven by their own needs and goals, and I wouldn't really think of those two as tied together in any way."", '\nJay Kornreich -- SMBC --
